PSALT Care Peer Support Groups,"PSALT Care Ltd (pronounced as ëSalt-careí), is a charity organisation set up to support and sustain persons with diagnosed mental health and addiction challenges, whom we refer to as ëclientsí, in their recovery journey. It is a fundamental belief in PSALT Care that recovery is possible. Recovery involves supporting clients, as they continue with the medication prescribed by their doctors, through modalities such as psychotherapy, mental health education and group support sessions. 

PSALT Care endeavours to support its clients by means of organising peer-led support group meetings which are facilitated by formally trained, volunteer Peer Support Specialists. These small group sessions, each comprising between 12-16 clients, meet regularly to briefly discuss a mental health topic and encourage one another in their recovery journey. Speaking with empathy from their own lived experiences, the peers and their facilitator share a common bond and sphere of encouragement that non-peers may not fully appreciate.",PSALT Care,https://chidnast.sirv.com/SchemesSG/psaltcare.jpg,https://www.psaltcare.com/,In need of mental healthcare,mental health support group,Mental Health
