Assistance for Kidney Patients,"The programme provides assistance to needy kidney patients regardless of race and religion, and is available to both Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. Patients may apply for the assistance through medical social workers, and each case will be assessed by a Tzu Chi home visit team. Tzu Chi also provides transport allowances for patients with mobility problems who are unable to afford the transport costs of travelling between their home and the dialysis centre.
