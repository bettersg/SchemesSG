    "\n",
    "1. No good means of quantitatively evaluating model performance. \n",
    "- Solution 1: Human eval. Get a bunch of volunteers, (query, link) pairs, and ask volunteers to rate 1-5 for relevance (industry practice). \n",
    "- Solution 2: Logging. Put the system in the wild, use clicks as proxies for relevant and impressions / non-clicks otherwise.\n",
    "    - Problem is that logging is another whole issue altogether. Not a lightweight solution at all\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Lack of data\n",
    "- LSI inferences are made with a small dataset of at most 100+ words\n",

    "1. Query Augmentation:\n",
