"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1,understand people reply immediately

"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

*****

We'd also like to draw your attention to our reformatted rules at  /r/depression/about/rules, which we soft-launched a few months ago.  As part of that, we developed two detailed wikis with lots of reference information.  

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance on how -- and how not -- to offer help and support here.  

YSK that the types of rule violations that cause us the most trouble here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule.  You should never trust *anyone* who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here.  See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact 

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity.  The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.  

* General-interest posts, or posts about causes or issues.  All these are either off topic (rule 1) or activism (rule 10).  

* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts.  This is an expert-free zone -- that's what *peer support* means (rule 5).  We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions.  Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.  

* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses.  Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.  The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1,welcome r depression check post place take moment share going accomplishment want talk standalone post sub violate role model rule welcome tough time prefer make post place share also like draw attention reformatted rule r depression rule soft launched month ago part developed two detailed wikis lot reference information r depression wiki what_is_depression provides guidance depressive disorder guidance complex nature illness usually grouped depression label redirect information common topic issue r depression wiki giving_help offer information nature value peer support mental health issue general lot guidance offer help support ysk type rule violation cause u trouble people breaking private contact rule never trust anyone try get private conversation response post see r depression wiki private_contact help post show understand basic principle peer support especially selectivity giving help wiki explains general interest post post cause issue either topic rule 1 activism rule 10 role modelling e achievement advice post expert free zone peer support mean rule 5 know internet culture celebrate bragging achievement bragging good intention nothing like ever acceptable topic post difficult situation circumstance including interpersonal loss grief sadness anger difficult emotion mental illness depression wiki ha suggestion place post issue 100 valid serious inappropriate,welcome r depression check post place take moment share going accomplishment want talk standalone post sub violate role model rule welcome tough time prefer make post place share also like draw attention reformatted rule r depression rule soft launched month ago part developed two detailed wikis lot reference information r depression wiki what_is_depression provides guidance depressive disorder guidance complex nature illness usually grouped depression label redirect information common topic issue r depression wiki giving_help offer information nature value peer support mental health issue general lot guidance offer help support ysk type rule violation cause u trouble people breaking private contact rule never trust anyone try get private conversation response post see r depression wiki private_contact help post show understand basic principle peer support especially selectivity giving help wiki explains general interest post post cause issue either topic rule 1 activism rule 10 role modelling e achievement advice post expert free zone peer support mean rule 5 know internet culture celebrate bragging achievement bragging good intention nothing like ever acceptable topic post difficult situation circumstance including interpersonal loss grief sadness anger difficult emotion mental illness depression wiki ha suggestion place post issue 100 valid serious inappropriate

"For a while know I've felt real down and lost in life. I spend my time at home most of the time, stuck in a dumb routine. School, procrastinate, homework, waste a lot of time, repeat. All my days are the same, but I feel like I can't really get out of it. 

No one in my family really seems to care to listen to me. My mother never takes me seriously and just uses me as a free therapy sponge, every time I go and talk to my sister she is always annoyed at me, my dad doesn't really live with me and most of our conversations are questions and answers. 

I feel lost. I want things. I know what I should do. I make plans and try to follow through. I hit a roadblock and even though I don't want to go back, I let myself slide back into the bad routine. 

There are times when I don't even enjoy what I'm doing. With school, I'm just going because its just two more semesters and I get the title. 

Once I enjoyed videogames but now it just feels like I'm forcing myself to play just to stop thinking or to be nice with my friends whenever they want to play. 

For the last year and a half, the days have been the same. Only slight changes. I've nearly wasted 1/10th of my life doing nothing.

How can I stop self sabotaging? How can I drop the videogame, videos, and tv binging addictions? How can I make myself productive? How can I be healthier? How can I feel happier?

I really want to improve, I want to succeed in life. I just feel so stuck.",1,know felt real lost life spend time home time stuck dumb routine school procrastinate homework waste lot time repeat day feel like really get one family really seems care listen mother never take seriously us free therapy sponge every time go talk sister always annoyed dad really live conversation question answer feel lost want thing know make plan try follow hit roadblock even though want go back let slide back bad routine time even enjoy school going two semester get title enjoyed videogames feel like forcing play stop thinking nice friend whenever want play last year half day slight change nearly wasted 1 10th life nothing stop self sabotaging drop videogame video tv binging addiction make productive healthier feel happier really want improve want succeed life feel stuck,know felt real lost life spend time home time stuck dumb routine school procrastinate homework waste lot time repeat day feel like really get one family really seems care listen mother never take seriously us free therapy sponge every time go talk sister always annoyed dad really live conversation question answer feel lost want thing know make plan try follow hit roadblock even though want go back let slide back bad routine time even enjoy school going two semester get title enjoyed videogames feel like forcing play stop thinking nice friend whenever want play last year half day slight change nearly wasted 1 10th life nothing stop self sabotaging drop videogame video tv binging addiction make productive healthier feel happier really want improve want succeed life feel stuck

"I have this obsessive need to reminisce over practically anything and I can't stop looking back. Oh, there's these pictures I've taken from the home I've once been in for 3 years. Let's stop and look at those while the memories flood in again from the good times, but also the bad ones that explains why I'm not there anymore.

Oh, I seem to keep listening to a podcast that puts me back into the mindset like I'm in high school again, when I've graduated 14 years ago. Nothing that this podcast is even going on about is relevant because it too, is 14 years ago and older.

Same with youtube videos, where I want to watch the same things. The fuck is wrong with me? It wastes so much of my time that I'm practically clueless into what I want to do with my life. Every weekend, I make empty promises to myself to do something new, watch something new, play something new .etc  


But no, I'm on my ass, infront of the PC and just...reminiscing. If I'm not on my ass infront of the PC, then I'm outside doing the same thing.

“You have demons in you. I tried to go to God on you &amp; you still haven’t changed or tried to.”
“Yes I’ve been ignoring you, I’m not even gonna lie.”
“Do better. 🙄”
“You don’t do anything at all.”

I don’t even want to continue because I’m getting pissed writing this out. Point is, everyone showed me exactly who they were when I needed them the most.

"Depression feels like a endurance test that never ends you may get breaks here and there from sleep, drugs ect.. but it's here to stay and fuck with you until you are dead. There's no amount of therapy that can take it away the only good thing about therapy is to vent and tell another human being face to face that life is shit and you have suicidal thoughts.

"Hey everyone, thank you all for being a part of this group.

I think we can agree that from 2020 onwards, it’s felt live we’ve all been through at least three lifetimes. I can unfortunately say it’s been the case for me. 

And it’s been exhausting being in survival mode for nearly two years. 

I’m looking for support because while I have wonderful friends, none of them truly understand my situation, try as they might.

For context: I live with severely immunocompromised parents, I’m unemployed and while I’ve suffered from depression for over a decade, the depressive and anxious episodes have been at an all time high since last year. 

 I’ll do best my to sum everything up: 

February 2020: Lose my job - work until March instead of September 

March 2020: First boyfriend I was in love with broke up with me three days after country borders are closed off 

July - August 2020: Lose four family members (two uncles, an aunt and a cousin) in 30 days - one from cancer, three from COVID. 

March 2021: Lose aunt to Parkinson’s 

May 2021: Find out I have a tumor and that it could be malignant. Thankfully it isn’t, but developed a nasty infection during biopsy that could’ve developed into sepsis. You all know what that means… this led to a 10 day stay in the hospital to keep said infection at bay. 

June 2021: Have said tumor as well as tonsils removed - worst pain ever. 

September 2021: Go abroad to start a new and exciting job…

October 2021: Only to find out I was scammed and deceived, and my employer tried to break into my apartment. I packed up and left 3 weeks after arriving (spent two of those weeks in quarantine). 

All of this on top of being a husk of my former self. I was an outgoing, fun person who’d either have friends over, go to friends’ houses or go out all the time. Now? I feel like I’m forgetting how to socialize. 

I’m an anxious mess whenever I’m in close quarters with unmasked people (even if I’m double masking and in spite of the fact that I’ve been fully vaccinated for several months) because I’m worried about contracting COVID and killing my family. 

I also live in an unsafe country where I can’t even walk the street where I live without worrying about being jumped or shanked. 

I’ve been unemployed since March of this year, which is especially frustrating given how I powered through all the horrible stuff my family went through to hand in my Masters thesis a week early. Thankfully I passed and got my Masters degree. 

But I don’t know what to do.

I normally hate complaining, because if I complain it means I’m doing something to change my circumstances. However, the only way I can be at peace and happy is by finding a job abroad that’ll let me live away from my family and not have to worry about their lives every single time I go out. 

I’ve worked hard, studied hard and been an active member of the academic communities I was a part of. I miss traveling, meeting others and enjoying life. 

I’m lost, depressed and angry at the world and mostly myself. 

I’ve been crying myself to sleep almost every night and I don’t know what to do. I feel like giving up, getting money however I can, vanishing and running off somewhere so I can start fresh.",1,hey everyone thank part group think agree 2020 onwards felt live least three lifetime unfortunately say case exhausting survival mode nearly two year looking support wonderful friend none truly understand situation try might context live severely immunocompromised parent unemployed suffered depression decade depressive anxious episode time high since last year best sum everything february 2020 lose job work march instead september march 2020 first boyfriend wa love broke three day country border closed july august 2020 lose four family member two uncle aunt cousin 30 day one cancer three covid march 2021 lose aunt parkinson may 2021 find tumor could malignant thankfully developed nasty infection biopsy could developed sepsis know mean led 10 day stay hospital keep said infection bay june 2021 said tumor well tonsil removed worst pain ever september 2021 go abroad start new exciting job october 2021 find wa scammed deceived employer tried break apartment packed left 3 week arriving spent two week quarantine top husk former self wa outgoing fun person either friend go friend house go time feel like forgetting socialize anxious mess whenever close quarter unmasked people even double masking spite fact fully vaccinated several month worried contracting covid killing family also live unsafe country even walk street live without worrying jumped shanked unemployed since march year especially frustrating given powered horrible stuff family went hand master thesis week early thankfully passed got master degree know normally hate complaining complain mean something change circumstance however way peace happy finding job abroad let live away family worry life every single time go worked hard studied hard active member academic community wa part miss traveling meeting others enjoying life lost depressed angry world mostly cry sleep almost every night know feel like giving getting money however vanishing running somewhere start fresh,hey everyone thank part group think agree 2020 onwards felt live least three lifetime unfortunately say case exhausting survival mode nearly two year looking support wonderful friend none truly understand situation try might context live severely immunocompromised parent unemployed suffered depression decade depressive anxious episode time high since last year best sum everything february 2020 lose job work march instead september march 2020 first boyfriend wa love broke three day country border closed july august 2020 lose four family member two uncle aunt cousin 30 day one cancer three covid march 2021 lose aunt parkinson may 2021 find tumor could malignant thankfully developed nasty infection biopsy could developed sepsis know mean led 10 day stay hospital keep said infection bay june 2021 said tumor well tonsil removed worst pain ever september 2021 go abroad start new exciting job october 2021 find wa scammed deceived employer tried break apartment packed left 3 week arriving spent two week quarantine top husk former self wa outgoing fun person either friend go friend house go time feel like forgetting socialize anxious mess whenever close quarter unmasked people even double masking spite fact fully vaccinated several month worried contracting covid killing family also live unsafe country even walk street live without worrying jumped shanked unemployed since march year especially frustrating given powered horrible stuff family went hand master thesis week early thankfully passed got master degree know normally hate complaining complain mean something change circumstance however way peace happy finding job abroad let live away family worry life every single time go worked hard studied hard active member academic community wa part miss traveling meeting others enjoying life lost depressed angry world mostly cry sleep almost every night know feel like giving getting money however vanishing running somewhere start fresh

"I don't know where to go from here, I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I've been battling severe, constant depression and anxiety for around seven years. I feel like I'm at my worst. I've lost all motivation to shower, turn in assignments, be awake, and even do the hobbies I enjoy. I have no friends, no outlet to talk to. I feel like my parents are distant from me, like I'm failing them. I'm faling all my classes, it pains me just to go to class and sit there for hours, looking at words not having a single interest or meaning because i dont honestly want to be there, or here, or anywhere. I just don't want to.. be.
 Nothing I do can ever be enough. I've gotten so angry, every little inconvenience sets me off and I feel so guilty about it but in that moment I can't even help to realize what I'm saying. My boyfriend keeps telling me how my mood swings affect him, and I try so, so hard to be happy and good for him. Tonight I was irritated because of another personal issue, and he told me that he was trying to be sweet but ""nevermind, you're always in a bad mood"" and I went off, I told him just to go to bed and leave me alone and he got angry at me . 
  I've done so much to try and cheer him up and to fix everything he hates but at the end of the day it's NEVER ENOUGH. Whenever I need his support he always finds a way to invalidate it.

"I fucking hate people so much. They are the bane of my fucking existence and I feel no regret saying this. Nobody has and never will give me a purpose to live for. The only thing that even brings me the slightest bit of joy is the gym and my own self improvement.

I don’t know why I was even put on this earth, I honestly don’t enjoy life and all the other bullshit that comes along with it. Life is not something I asked for, it offers nothing but pain and temporary moments of relief. Growing up with autism I would be ridiculed for being myself and it tanked my confidence, it made me think that I had to be like someone else to be “normal”. It made me bottle up my emotions and not want to speak about my mental struggle because I felt I never had anyone who would genuinely listen to what I had to say or even care about what i’m going through. Needless to say, I have no friends, a broken family, no confidence and no desire to live.

"I've had depression for an unknown amount of time. I didn't know what depression was, I think. I just knew that I couldn't remember much of my childhood (maybe the equivalent of two years for my first seventeen years?). I knew it was likely due to trauma, but never really explored it.

Then, about two months before my husband died, he got a therapist. She was great, and my husband wanted me to be involved, so I was usually included in his sessions with her. Ended up that I would talk to her about the issues that I saw, but that he was relunctant to talk about. Then he died, the day after his last session with her. Which was actually just her chatting with me, about how he was doing, and how to help him get through some recent positive changes.

When he died, even though I didn't have qualifying insurance, she started seeing me directly. For free. And she was able to somewhat help me, she did a wonderful job as a grief counselor (later morphed into a general couselor for anxiety and depression, which helped me get my disability). But I was never able to get over some guilt from my husband's death. And it later caused me to take some risky behavior.

I went over not only that risky behavior with her, but other thoughts and behaviors that would have probably caused a therapist to consider admitting me. However, rather than go to that step, she would go through the sessions, and come back with education about our discussions. I mean, I spoke to her about wanting punishment (not for enjoyment), but she would come back the next week (she basically saw me weekly, sometimes twice a week, for almost the entire time she was my therapist, paid or free). She always came back with ways to ensure that I wasn't going too far, even when I didn't care.

I did almost go too far, a couple times. But she kept on trying to help me. Even discharged me, then took me back as a patient when I told her about trying to go too far, in a pretty dangerous way. Honestly, I didn't expect her to take me back as a patient, even though she probably understood me and my reasons better than anyone else. Including myself. Over the next two years, she and I would talk about how my life was developing. Sometimes we would go off topic, just chatter about how things in the world were weird, awful, or going in a good (or bad) direction. She was honestly the closest thing to a friend I have.

Then, last week, she told me that she was going to be quitting. Her health had always been fragile. She would end up cancelling sessions because she couldn't come in. It happened fairly often, and I understood why she was quitting. But I thought that she was continuing for a little longer, like a couple weeks, or maybe a month. I thought I had time. She only told me, right before hanging up, that she was leaving.

Then, a week ago, I found out that she was leaving effective for this week. So, I arranged to come in, to make a personal last goodbye. But, when my ride was supposed to pick me up, I found out that the session was cancelled. That she wasn't coming back, I wouldn't have a chance to even say goodbye.

All I could do was text her. Hope that she received that, my attempt at a goodbye. To a person that basically helped keep me on a somewhat even keel. Not perfect, never perfect. But I could talk to her, and tell her things that I couldn't say to anyone else. And now, I'm expected to transition to another therapist. Who may be wonderful, but she truly won't understand me, not the way this therapist does.

And now, it hasn't even been two weeks since I last talked to her. But I'm already lost. I'm already seeing myself looking at my past, and feeling like I won't be able to stop. I can so easily see myself not caring again. And wanting to just let whatever happen, happen. I have a bf, but for the past year, I haven't really figured out what to think regarding us. And this just makes me feel like, like I'm back to feeling like I don't matter again. And feeling that way just makes my guilt start to loom over me again. And although I feel pain differently from how I did before, it means that maybe it will be more meaningful, if I follow through. I don't think I'm the low level masochist I was, so maybe, this time, maybe it will end. I already miss her, but I wish her the best going forward.",1,depression unknown amount time know depression wa think knew remember much childhood maybe equivalent two year first seventeen year knew wa likely due trauma never really explored two month husband died got therapist wa great husband wanted involved wa usually included session ended would talk issue saw wa relunctant talk died day last session wa actually chatting wa help get recent positive change died even though qualifying insurance started seeing directly free wa able somewhat help wonderful job grief counselor later morphed general couselor anxiety depression helped get disability wa never able get guilt husband death later caused take risky behavior went risky behavior thought behavior would probably caused therapist consider admitting however rather go step would go session come back education discussion mean spoke wanting punishment enjoyment would come back next week basically saw weekly sometimes twice week almost entire time wa therapist paid free always came back way ensure going far even care almost go far couple time kept trying help even discharged took back patient told trying go far pretty dangerous way honestly expect take back patient even though probably understood reason better anyone else including next two year would talk life wa developing sometimes would go topic chatter thing world weird awful going good bad direction wa honestly closest thing friend last week told wa going quitting health always fragile would end cancelling session come happened fairly often understood wa quitting thought wa continuing little longer like couple week maybe month thought time told right hanging wa leaving week ago found wa leaving effective week arranged come make personal last goodbye ride wa supposed pick found session wa cancelled coming back chance even say goodbye could wa text hope received attempt goodbye person basically helped keep somewhat even keel perfect never perfect could talk tell thing say anyone else expected transition another therapist may wonderful truly understand way therapist doe even two week since last talked already lost already seeing looking past feeling like able stop easily see caring wanting let whatever happen happen bf past year really figured think regarding u make feel like like back feeling like matter feeling way make guilt start loom although feel pain differently mean maybe meaningful follow think low level masochist wa maybe time maybe end already miss wish best going forward,depression unknown amount time know depression wa think knew remember much childhood maybe equivalent two year first seventeen year knew wa likely due trauma never really explored two month husband died got therapist wa great husband wanted involved wa usually included session ended would talk issue saw wa relunctant talk died day last session wa actually chatting wa help get recent positive change died even though qualifying insurance started seeing directly free wa able somewhat help wonderful job grief counselor later morphed general couselor anxiety depression helped get disability wa never able get guilt husband death later caused take risky behavior went risky behavior thought behavior would probably caused therapist consider admitting however rather go step would go session come back education discussion mean spoke wanting punishment enjoyment would come back next week basically saw weekly sometimes twice week almost entire time wa therapist paid free always came back way ensure going far even care almost go far couple time kept trying help even discharged took back patient told trying go far pretty dangerous way honestly expect take back patient even though probably understood reason better anyone else including next two year would talk life wa developing sometimes would go topic chatter thing world weird awful going good bad direction wa honestly closest thing friend last week told wa going quitting health always fragile would end cancelling session come happened fairly often understood wa quitting thought wa continuing little longer like couple week maybe month thought time told right hanging wa leaving week ago found wa leaving effective week arranged come make personal last goodbye ride wa supposed pick found session wa cancelled coming back chance even say goodbye could wa text hope received attempt goodbye person basically helped keep somewhat even keel perfect never perfect could talk tell thing say anyone else expected transition another therapist may wonderful truly understand way therapist doe even two week since last talked already lost already seeing looking past feeling like able stop easily see caring wanting let whatever happen happen bf past year really figured think regarding u make feel like like back feeling like matter feeling way make guilt start loom although feel pain differently mean maybe meaningful follow think low level masochist wa maybe time maybe end already miss wish best going forward

"I received my diagnosis of mixed anxiety depressive disorder in 2017 and have been working on it since then.  I had been making excellent strides and thought I was finally ready to fulfill my dream of having a dog.  I moved to a dog friendly apartment and chose to adopt a dog through a local rescue.  This rescue unfortunately did not disclose that the dog had heartworm, a bleeding disorder, severe anxiety, chronic stress colitis (think diarrhea after every slightly stressful event … like a bus going by, or me standing up too fast), and a seizure disorder.  The last four months have been nothing but vet appointments, ER trips, cleaning up dog waste, and medications.  I can’t leave her home, I can’t have people over, and I’ve never felt more alone.  I’m wracked by guilt over my feelings towards this sweet girl that never asked for any of this, and anxiety that something will happen to her.

"I've lost my appetite, humor, personality, sleep, motivation, and sex drive. My girlfriend broke up with me 3 days ago. She hadn't talked to me in a week, and finally came over tuesday to talk. She told me how she didn't like herself, and needed to heal for herself and no one else, so she left me. She is the love of my life, my partner, the person I dream of spending the rest of my life with. And now she's gone. Idk if its for a time or forever, but every moment I'm not in her life feels painful. I miss our intimacy, how she knew how to make me laugh or feel good after a long or difficult day. The way I would look in her eyes and see the love she held for me. Our kisses, inside jokes, dumb routines, how I used to bother her playfully. I want her to get better, but I know I can't rush it or put a timeline on self healing. Our last words to each other before she left was “I love you”.

"For four years, I have wallowed by myself in the darkness of my room. Afraid of basic human interactions. Unable to communicate my thoughts and feelings with a world that views me as an outsider. Petrified of building intimate relationships after losing the one I thought I would spend my life with.

I moved across the country. Away from my friends, my family, my ex. Just hoping to create a new identify for myself. Discover happiness again. Free myself from the abhorrent version of me I’ve built up in my head.

A year and a half later and I’m finally doing the things that are supposed to make me feel better. I have started therapy. I joined a new club. I even have my first doctors appointment scheduled to discuss my issues with anxiety and depression.

Yet I’ve never felt so alone.

I’m tired of lonely nights all by myself. I’m agitated all the time. I’m upset that I can’t control my urges to eat all the food in my cabinets at night. I’m angry that I struggle to let people in. And most of all, I’m disappointed that I can’t figure out how to change myself into the man I want to be.

I’ve been really stressed out lately and I’m getting concerned because it’s becoming much more frequent.

"i’m 20, just got out of a 3 year relationship, and i can’t stop thinking about this girl that i met before my ex. we met in highschool, 4 years ago, then grew into very close friends. she told me everything, i told her everything : i had never been this close with someone in my life. our relationship was special : we were only friends, but we were always cuddling and doing relationship-like activities. she had her own demons and issues and all i wanted to do was to be there for her. and so i started having feelings, i loved her. you see, she was my first love, and it was very hard seeing her date other people. her relationships were toxic, and i was the one that was there for her no matter what happened. she would constantly come to me to cry in my arms, the type of crying where you have a hard time even breathing. one day, i couldn’t take the pain of being in love with my best friend who was seeing other people, and so i told her everything. i poured my heart out to her. i also realized that this situation was destroying me, that i needed to move on, so i put an end to our relationship. we had mutual friends, and one of her friends told me that she was having a hard time without me, she wanted me back in her life. i never came back, i couldn’t handle the pain anymore. 

shortly after i met my ex. we had a beautiful three year relationship. while we dated, i sometimes thought about this girl that i used to be in love with, i missed her. but no, i had moved on from this part of my life, i was happy in my current relationship, and i couldn’t go back to this toxicity. my ex then left me for her best friend. what goes around comes around i guess. 

i’m writing this to you 6 months later. i now feel ok about my breakup, which was my first. the thing is, i can’t stop thinking about this girl that i used to be in love with. she haunts my mind. i texted her a couple of months ago to check up on her, as after all, we were really good friends. our conversation was dry, nothing came out of it, which makes sense as we stopped talking on bad terms and as she is in a relationship right now. i know that there is probably nothing to do, people change and move on, but i miss her, and i miss the emotional connection that we had. i am depressed, my life is boring. i just want to feel something. i have not felt the emotional intensity that i felt with this girl ever since we stopped talking. that is, not even with my ex. i don’t know if there’s anything to even say about my situation, i just wanted to talk with someone.",1,20 got 3 year relationship stop thinking girl met ex met highschool 4 year ago grew close friend told everything told everything never close someone life relationship wa special friend always cuddling relationship like activity demon issue wanted wa started feeling loved see wa first love wa hard seeing date people relationship toxic wa one wa matter happened would constantly come cry arm type cry hard time even breathing one day take pain love best friend wa seeing people told everything poured heart also realized situation wa destroying needed move put end relationship mutual friend one friend told wa hard time without wanted back life never came back handle pain anymore shortly met ex beautiful three year relationship dated sometimes thought girl used love missed moved part life wa happy current relationship go back toxicity ex left best friend go around come around guess writing 6 month later feel ok breakup wa first thing stop thinking girl used love haunt mind texted couple month ago check really good friend conversation wa dry nothing came make sense stopped talking bad term relationship right know probably nothing people change move miss miss emotional connection depressed life boring want feel something felt emotional intensity felt girl ever since stopped talking even ex know anything even say situation wanted talk someone,20 got 3 year relationship stop thinking girl met ex met highschool 4 year ago grew close friend told everything told everything never close someone life relationship wa special friend always cuddling relationship like activity demon issue wanted wa started feeling loved see wa first love wa hard seeing date people relationship toxic wa one wa matter happened would constantly come cry arm type cry hard time even breathing one day take pain love best friend wa seeing people told everything poured heart also realized situation wa destroying needed move put end relationship mutual friend one friend told wa hard time without wanted back life never came back handle pain anymore shortly met ex beautiful three year relationship dated sometimes thought girl used love missed moved part life wa happy current relationship go back toxicity ex left best friend go around come around guess writing 6 month later feel ok breakup wa first thing stop thinking girl used love haunt mind texted couple month ago check really good friend conversation wa dry nothing came make sense stopped talking bad term relationship right know probably nothing people change move miss miss emotional connection depressed life boring want feel something felt emotional intensity felt girl ever since stopped talking even ex know anything even say situation wanted talk someone

"i just wanna rant, have no one i wanna be a burden to. 
i feel like im gonna be stuck in this cycle of depression forever and i just cant get out. i want to get better, but i dont care enough to do so anymore, and honestly, i’ve lost all motivation to do it. i’ve been dealing with depression since i was 12, now I’m 20, and its the worst its ever been. I’ve gotten way more sensitive and sadder, and anything can send me spiraling. My grades have gone down. I barely go outside. My anxiety has also gotten worse and I can barely speak to people without intense nerves and panic. The past 8 years I’ve been able to do these things and still deal with my depression but now its just exploded. It feels impossible to get better in the environment im living in right now, and I don’t know if I can make it to the day I can finally leave and begin a journey of healing. I’m aware that I’m responsible for my own journey to heal, but I dont know where to even start because my life is just always so crap that it feels useless to even try it. I am constantly reminded by the universe that nothing is ever gonna work out like I wish it would, no one is ever gonna love me, and I’m literally invisible to those around me. Every time I’ve started to feel better, it just ends in flames and I’m back to being me. I don’t know who i am without being depressed. I feel like I didnt even lose myself, there was barely anyone there to become and my entire identity is just made up of my sadness. On top of all this, I have no idea what I want to do with my life and have absolutely no passion nor talents at all to even motivate me into having a dream, and I hate myself for the mistakes I’ve made in life to lead me to where I’m at now and not leading myself in another direction, so that really doesnt help the depression lol. I’ve always wanted to be someone special in life, but I think im slowly starting realize im nothing special at all. I think realizing this has made me sadder and more negative about myself, realizing im always just gonna be the ugly “goofy” friend to any friend-group im in and be treated as such. I’m really tired of being treated that way, but it always ends up that way. Every period of my life, I’ve been that girl, and have ended up depressed while my friends have boyfriends, girlfriends, lives, meanwhile I’ve been rejected from every single person I’ve ever shown interest in haha. Im just so tired, I really just want to stop being so sad all the time and have a drive to live like everyone else around me, and have someone love me the way I see everyone get to have.

"24F. I have zero friends (sure a bunch of acquaintances, but nobody that actually knows the person behind the persona that I show the world). Nobody knows the misery and loneliness and depression that I truly live everyday. 
I’ve probably been on maybe 10 outings since COVID started, I have seriously become an isolated shell of myself. But I continue to portray to the world that I have it together and that I’m fine (I do this by staying active on my Instagram page, cuz If I’m active, it surely means life is still going for me), especially when I’m with those acquaintances of mine. I think I do it because I’m so embarrassed of the real situation that is my life- I don’t want to be judged, I don’t want to be looked at as the stupid loner. Everyone around me has their shit together and has an endless list of best friends and here I am with zero people to call an actual friend. 

I’ve been thinking about all of this lately and I’m so incredibly ashamed of myself- how the fuck did I get to this point? Why don’t I have any friends? Am I that unlikable? I’m too old to be making “new lifelong friends”. I’m so embarrassed of who I am and how much of a loser I am. Sometimes I even think of stuff like; If I were to get married, I don’t even know who I’d invite or who would be my brides maid. I have no one and I blame myself for it even though I don’t know how it got to this stage. 

I just wish I had friends that I can travel with, go out with, make memories with, all that stuff. But I have no one. Even my cousins and relatives I don’t have any relationship with.

"Do ugly people even have a purpose on this piece of sh*t planet? 

I feel like utter sh*t all the damn time and this gets amplified if I see someone attractive, even the average looking people out there just look far better than me. I feel so inferior to anyone I meet, I tried the gym...worst, I repeat the WORST mistake I ever made. I felt like a sewer rat among tigers and lions. 

I will never get a relationship, never have confidence and I will never be loved. I'm always surrounded by people that get into relationships and find love so easily. Why? Because they're attractive, one is literally a crack head that does hard drugs but still finds love. My brother who has anger issues, is in major debt and is homophobic, racist and is an out right pig. But guess what? None of that matters when you have a good face I guess, he's in a relationship shocker!

Sometimes depression hits me the hardest and most days I could be doing fine and not feeding into any of my negative thoughts but I don’t get validation from feeling good. I know it’s a temporary feeling so there’s no way to tell if my mind is lying to me or not. I feel so scared about opening up too because I’m invalidated every time.

"I'm sorry if this reads like me venting, but I have been thinking about suicide as a means of escaping my problems for many years now, but now I'm starting to think that I'm a liability for society and the people around me.


A few of the things I'm trying to escape are uncurable tinnitus, depression, chronical pain and panic attacks all keeping me up at night due to a mix of pain and spiraling thoughts and causing me to be sleep deprived. 


These plus my social anxiety/phobia (to the point I starve for two days before I can bring myself to get groceries/go outside), me being jobless for almost two years, having no friends and being too insecure to make friends, my father telling me he has no interest in my life two and a half years ago and my mother telling me something similar half a year ago make me think, that I am a lost cause and it would be easier for everyone if I was just gone. 


I tried getting therapy for a year, but it just made me accept my depression and my other problems it didn't really help or prevent the suicidal thoughts, I tried a lot of things, but I never really was happy or content with myself and my life.


The fact that the only two people in my life who should always support me have abandoned me gave me trust issues, questioning if anyone ever truly supported me or everyones words have been lies the whole time.


The only things keeping me going right now are my two cats, the obligation I have to take care of my disabled brother after my parents died and an acquaintance who supported me every time I bothered them with an issue of mine, but now I even question if this person's messages were all also lies and I don't know how long I can cling on to those small threads anymore and am scared of what I will do once they break or can't hold me any longer.

"This is my throwaway and I have no one to talk to about my problems.

I got into a car accident back in May of 2020. It was pretty fucking bad I ran into a semi truck head on at like 80 mph and don’t remember anything cause I fell asleep on the wheel but I woke up with broken femur bones, internal brain bleeding, etc. I was 17 at the time and at the top of the fucking world. I just got into UC Berkeley and had a whole future of aviation in front of me. I threw it all away. 

Fast forward to a lil over 1 year later and multiple surgeries my leg is still fucking stuck at 45 degrees and I cant bend or straighten it. Ive gone to multiple doctors and they all tell me the same thing we dont know what to do but we can try _____. The option they give me will still make me handicapped. 

My parents are spending so much money on the best insurance and doctors all for them to give us the same responses. They want to send me to Korea and see if the docs there got sum but bro if UCSF dont got a solution what makes me think Korea will???? I feel so so bad sitting everyday in my pc room just playing videogames all day trying to just get the next day to come. Im so so so so so tired of living like this I want to just get a fucking amputation and move onto the next hurdle in life. 

It makes me furious how one foolish mistake I made at an early age is costing my entire future. If I go through with the amputation I have to give up my dreams of being a pilot. My dad is a pilot and its been my childhood dream to follow his career path. I really hate myself so much. I cant even talk to my friends or family because I’ve talked to them so much about my leg and Im scared to annoy them anymore.

"I just hate the idea of being over 35 so much. Fading into the background and becoming invisible to everyone because women are only worthy if they are young and beautiful. I'm already hating myself because I don't have my 18yr old body anymore.

"Hello, longtime lurker, first time poster.

For those of you who have found an empathetic therapist who you feel truly listens to you and doesn’t just give you the “Therapy’s Greatest Hits” advice, do you have any tips for finding someone good?

Also, any tips for methods besides CBT? I personally don’t like CBT and find it insensitive. I’m open to other methods.

Empathetic responses only—I know it’s already in the rules, but anyone who wants to tell me “tough love” platitudes or be an apologist for shitty therapists can fuck right off. Thanks! 🙂",1,hello longtime lurker first time poster found empathetic therapist feel truly listens give therapy greatest hit advice tip finding someone good also tip method besides cbt personally like cbt find insensitive open method empathetic response know already rule anyone want tell tough love platitude apologist shitty therapist fuck right thanks,hello longtime lurker first time poster found empathetic therapist feel truly listens give therapy greatest hit advice tip finding someone good also tip method besides cbt personally like cbt find insensitive open method empathetic response know already rule anyone want tell tough love platitude apologist shitty therapist fuck right thanks

"Idk if this is the right space to vent about this but it's related to my depression so I guess it's alright.

After some months of thought, I've come to the realization that I think being around people only makes me feel worse. I think it's time I just decide to be alone. Idk if that means for the next year or for life.

I like having friends and talking to people but in the long run I never truly matter to those people. I'm either last choice or not even a good option. I always have to be the one to keep in touch or try keeping the friendship alive when they do nothing.

I'm always making sure I'm nice, open and funny so my friends enjoy being around me but I can never show them how depressed I actually am. They never even ask. I have to constantly be the extrovert when I'm extremely introverted. It's made me exhausted.

Plus, I'm always the listener/therapist friend. I only know one friend of mine who actually asks me how I'm doing and checks in on me. She's the only one I talk to regularly. Aside from her, I honestly don't mind cutting off everyone else. 

Maybe I'm the problem idk. Maybe I'm too nice or too boring or too something. Who knows. All I know is I'm tired of having to keep up appearances so people can like me.

All I want to do now is pack my bags, move away, and cut contact with everyone. Because it wouldn't change anything for them anyway. I'm not important enough to be missed by them. I'm tired of it. I don't even want to try making new friends anymore because this always happens. No one ever stays around me that long. No one ever genuinely listens or cares.

From now on, I just want to focus on me and my future. If I do make some real friends along the way, then that would be a nice change. But, I'm done trying let people in and only be forgotten by them.
I'm not even really depressed about my decision. I was at first, but now I've accepted it.

"Anyone else find that when you're low you know you're supposed to go for a walk and enjoy nature and the sunshine but you go out alone and you see nothing, you feel nothing. The sun's shining but who gives a shit. 

When I'm alone it feels like I have no desire to go out unless I have an actual reason, and I don't have any reason ever technically. 

I notice others not noticing me. I notice others smiling. When I do leave the house I just walk aimlessly around the block and I am already thinking of my shitty room, and how many steps it'll be before I'm back there.

Being depressed is easier now isn't it. Food delivered, video games, endless streaming, work from home. Video calls with the camera off. Rental properties stuck in your room, it's a fucking mess. Endless swipes to the right without a single message. Phone calls with your family where you give the best acting of your life saying how good everything is.

Go to sleep, amazing dreams and you wake up and the clocks reset and it's all where it was.

At some point I will need the energy and the strength as I get older but when I go into this downward spiral it is giving me diminishing returns, in a rapidly decaying orbit.

"Im so fucking drained. Hospitalization after hospitalization, attempt after attempt, the scars keep piling up. I look like ive been wrapped in barbed wire. Im fucking sick of this body, sick of this life, and sick of my fucking mind.

Talking to people does nothing. Medication does nothing. Help. Does. Nothing. Fucking nothing.

Last attempt i cut my arms, hopped in my car, and went 180km/h through my quiet town blasting music going over peoples front yards driving on whatever fucking side of the road i felt like at fucking 12am. I just drive and drove as my hands stuck to the wheel and blood coated my body. My arms tingling and me getting lightheaded from blood loss. Didnt stop until for whatever reason i drove to my workplace and called a workmate who works overnight. They called an ambulance and kept me alive until i was stitched up at a hospital.

Ive been out of hospital for a couple weeks now and i feel exactly where i was before i attempted.

Driving like a fucking maniac that night was the most fucking exhilarating feeling ive ever fucking felt and i want to experience it again, forever.

One change of medication, 2 psychologists, 3 psychiatrists, 1 mental health worker and fucking 30 scars later here i am again.

Why on earth would i want to change my medication if the last 13 havent worked, why would i want therapy if it hasnt helped for fucking 8 years.

I cant talk to anybody i know anymore because they all know whats happened to me, they'll call my family, my friends, the cops and an ambo and ill just get fucking hunted down like a loose fucking animal.

Talking and venting doesnt fucking help anymore anyway i only vent so that people can see the fucking end stage of depression and just how much it can fuck your life up.

I hope that nobody ever has to feel like this, ever. But i know people have, and people will. Depression fucking sucks. Mentall illness sucks. Everything fucking sucks.

Nothing can help, nothing has ever helped. It doesnt matter who you are. It doesnt matter how much everybody loves you. It doesnt matter how much support you get. Or how many drugs you take. Or how much therapy you get. It doesnt fucking matter. I dont matter.

This is what my brain decided. That nothing and nobody will ever matter.

Venting like this is just a fucking echo of what i think about every fucking minute of every fucking hour of every fucking day of every fucking year. Year after year.

I dont believe in a god, but i know that even if i did, it would not, fucking, matter.

What you are reading is the final stage of somebody's life.

Im not doing this for another 40 years.

"I'm just a person who suffers from depression and suicidal ideations.
I can't enjoy the things I used to like and for most of the day I almost do nothing except for laying in my bed and scrolling through YouTube or something. 
I just feel like such a big failure, because it seems like I can't do anything right.
It sometimes hurts to breath.
I don't think I can express the pain that I'm feeling on a daily basis.

I sometimes wish I wasn't born or that I would die in my sleep. Every morning that I wake up I get this doom like feeling and think ""I didn't die in my sleep.""

Ive been in and out of clinics (currently staying in a clinic) and I think I'm only bothering people around me like my friends, family and/or anyone who has gotten to know me.
I withdraw myself a lot from them recently...
I'm so negative and stress about the smallest things, so much so that I started crying almost every day (I usually don't cry)
Sometimes I even cry about the fact that everything feels ""too real"" (It's kinda hard to explain...)

I honestly don't think it's going to get better or that there is a bright future for me, I'm feel so hopeless.
I don't know what to say or type, there is so much going on around my head...

"My nineteen years of life are always been lonely and harsh but the last four where a complete disaster 
And they where what brought me to spiral in a very strong depression
It all started four years ago with my little brother being born dead....the news shattered something in me that day...and from there things started to go even more to shit
We had to leave our home because my grandmother  was ill and she needed help (we are still stucked in this situation) 
And then two years after the pandemic arrived and decide to screw us all over
In the months before the outbreak i had reached my limit and i snapped all this caused by the above factors combined plus me developing feelings for a girl that will never like me back (still like her and worst of all the feelings turned in full fledged love)
All this brought me to try to kill myself(prevented by one of my best friends)
during the quarantine i was suffering a lot cause I'm claustrophobic and the relationship between me and my parents was strained to say the least 
and now everyone is leaving......all of my friends are leaving to go to university 

And yesterday i fucked up the relationship with my crush by being an asshole (an we were having such a nice evening too dammit)

And now the loneliness is killing me from inside 
Im hating myself to death and i really wish to end all of this 

So i decided to share my story with the people here 
In hope that speaking with the people here would have made me fell less lonely",1,nineteen year life always lonely harsh last four complete disaster brought spiral strong depression started four year ago little brother born dead news shattered something day thing started go even shit leave home grandmother wa ill needed help still stucked situation two year pandemic arrived decide screw u month outbreak reached limit snapped caused factor combined plus developing feeling girl never like back still like worst feeling turned full fledged love brought try kill prevented one best friend quarantine wa suffering lot cause claustrophobic relationship parent wa strained say least everyone leaving friend leaving go university yesterday fucked relationship crush asshole nice evening dammit loneliness killing inside im hating death really wish end decided share story people hope speaking people would made fell le lonely,nineteen year life always lonely harsh last four complete disaster brought spiral strong depression started four year ago little brother born dead news shattered something day thing started go even shit leave home grandmother wa ill needed help still stucked situation two year pandemic arrived decide screw u month outbreak reached limit snapped caused factor combined plus developing feeling girl never like back still like worst feeling turned full fledged love brought try kill prevented one best friend quarantine wa suffering lot cause claustrophobic relationship parent wa strained say least everyone leaving friend leaving go university yesterday fucked relationship crush asshole nice evening dammit loneliness killing inside im hating death really wish end decided share story people hope speaking people would made fell le lonely

"Even the thought of supporting and helping someone mentally makes me feel so defeated. I’m so tired of helping people with their problems, or people opening up to me about them. I just feel annoyed and have such a low tolerance for people going through a hard time. Frankly, I don’t want to be anywhere near them

This just sucks the life out of me and I can’t do it anymore. Even the slightest complaint like “I’m feeling sad lately” triggers me. I can’t devote my time to healing people, especially people I don’t care about much.

I don’t want to be the person people lean on. I’d rather just be left alone.

I know this is selfish but I feel like it takes too much from me, and I don’t have a lot to begin with keeping me stable.

Messaged my friend today “what’s up” and she said “idk feeling sad” and I just cannot do it. I don’t want to know why you are sad. I don’t want to help you. I just want to have my peace.

I used to be very rehabilitative towards people but I feel burnt out and I don’t care.

I don’t want the responsibility of helping people anymore. I hardly get any attention myself and I just can’t give it to other people. I don’t want to ask “why are you sad” “what’s wrong”. Just tell me STRAIGHT UP and maybe I can give you some advice but I’m not here to beg you to tell me. I don’t even want to know. 

If they said “this is my problem, what advice do you have” no problem I’ll tell you 

If you say “I feel sad” I don’t care to ask why.

Does this make sense?

Over the years I've had alot of up amd downs but I recently suffered a pregnancy loss and I'm now back at my lowest point. I'm been given medication for the pain and clonazepam temporarily before they will put me back on my regular anti depressant. I just feel so alone in my own little bubble and I dont feel like anything is helping. In my head I just want to take all the medication I've been given at once just to feel better even for a little bit. I was barely managing my depression before this but now I just feel even more empty like I finally had this day of hope and it was taken away so suddenly and so traumatically I dont even know how I can even recover from this.,1,year alot amd recently suffered pregnancy loss back lowest point given medication pain clonazepam temporarily put back regular anti depressant feel alone little bubble dont feel like anything helping head want take medication given feel better even little bit wa barely managing depression feel even empty like finally day hope wa taken away suddenly traumatically dont even know even recover,year alot amd recently suffered pregnancy loss back lowest point given medication pain clonazepam temporarily put back regular anti depressant feel alone little bubble dont feel like anything helping head want take medication given feel better even little bit wa barely managing depression feel even empty like finally day hope wa taken away suddenly traumatically dont even know even recover

"Anyone else feel this way? For context, im 17, junior in highschool and just moved to a new state and school ~2 months ago. Since then, ive made no friends, feel shitty, and always tired &amp; procrastinating. I hate life rn. I left my korean church (im korean) which was my closest thing to a family to me, and havent really contacted any former friends. I tried joining other korean churches here but none of them feel welcoming or even care about me. I dont feel like i can ever make good friendships with old friends either, bcs most of them are turning to bad paths doing drugs, smoking, etc. Besides that, the i havent made any connections with any people here. Im generally a shy person, so when i had the courage to ask a couple people for their socials, i thought i would get to know them better, but nothings changed. This might seem selfish, but out of the ~25 people ive gotten to know, not a single one of them bothered to ask for my socials or interact with me outside of classes, which makes me feel even more shitty. And to top it all off, studying and trying to look good for college sucks the life out of me. However, with all this, ive never considered suicide. I want to live. I want to go to college. I want to experience a relationship. Just now, things fucking suck. Ive tried doing so many things to help myself (starting powerlifting, learning new things, etc) but i feel so lonely.

"I think I'm depressed (tho I never went to therapy so maybe it's just me wanting to self-diagnose), but not in a ""can't get out of bed or take a bath and feel sad all the time"" way, but in like ""living is so draining, I'm tired of many things but I do them anyway, I don't see a future for myself, can't even bring myself to do the things I liked before""

I have very few friends and don't know how to socialize. I hate studying but I do it to keep my good grades and to maybe have a brighter future (which I don't see yet). My life is good, I have fun and laugh at school and my family is great. I do everything I need to and my life goes on, nothing special. I find some joy in specific activities (and all of them include being on my phone to procrastinate). So the problem is me.

I feel empty most of the time (specially when I'm alone), and it's getting worse. I'm a person that drains other people's energy with my negativity and lack of enthusiasm. It sucks, I suck, and I'm tired of being so unbearable. I wish I had the guts to die, I think very often how it'd be good if I wasn't born. But I know deep inside I don't actually want to die so I'll never have a plan to do it. This depression (if it is depression, after all) just makes me tired of living, but my life is okay so I should just hurry up and feel better.

"Ever since I was little I knew something was wrong with me mentally.

I’m not able to express my emotions clearly or effectively whatsoever 

Growing up, this mainly effected me in that I was a pretty shy kid with a small friend group, and always feared a few insecurities of mine

Fast forward to high school and college, the effects became stronger on my mental health

I’ve always been one to do well in school, so my parents always assumed I’m “smart”. They set high expectations for me like any parent would. In high school this dealt with grades, test scores, and college admissions

In college, this dealt with grades, getting internships, and eventually preparing for a career

The problem is, I do not consider myself “smart” so I view my expectations as a bit unreasonable. Everyone I know around me wants so much from me

I have no motivation to work towards this success that is expected from me. I don’t feel “lazy” physically but rather mentally.

My mom constantly complains about every little action or mistake I make. It really has a toll on my mind and my heart

I know she wants to do what she thinks is right for me (push me towards success) but in reality she is pushing me down a dark hole of depression

I don’t sleep at night because I don’t want to have to wake up and deal with the same issues again and again 

At night I finally have someone to talk to, as I am able to clear my mind and think to myself

In fact, being alone is the only time I am happy

I guess I am just tired of everyone thinking what they’re doing is good for me when in reality they are hurting me

In the past I’ve spoken to my family regarding my depressive state but it seems like they act like that conversation never happened

I don’t know what to do anymore. Everyday I wake up, follow commands from my parents, and go to sleep

I no longer have any friends and am finding it impossible to get a job now that I graduated college 

My mom gets mad at me for “showing attitude” to her when all I do when I feel bad is quietly lay in bed just so I can temporarily forget about the demons that are eating away from my mind

Our family is well off and well educated, so any time I’m mistreated and complain even an ounce, the comparisons roll out “when I was your age” “this person’s son did this” etc

I’m sorry for the long message. I don’t have anyone to talk to but myself. Sometimes I wish I had kept a diary so one day maybe my mom will understand what I’ve been going through

I know somethings wrong with me, I just wish I knew what that something is. Maybe I can finally be at peace then",1,ever since wa little knew something wa wrong mentally able express emotion clearly effectively whatsoever growing mainly effected wa pretty shy kid small friend group always feared insecurity mine fast forward high school college effect became stronger mental health always one well school parent always assumed smart set high expectation like parent would high school dealt grade test score college admission college dealt grade getting internship eventually preparing career problem consider smart view expectation bit unreasonable everyone know around want much motivation work towards success expected feel lazy physically rather mentally mom constantly complains every little action mistake make really ha toll mind heart know want think right push towards success reality pushing dark hole depression sleep night want wake deal issue night finally someone talk able clear mind think fact alone time happy guess tired everyone thinking good reality hurting past spoken family regarding depressive state seems like act like conversation never happened know anymore everyday wake follow command parent go sleep longer friend finding impossible get job graduated college mom get mad showing attitude feel bad quietly lay bed temporarily forget demon eating away mind family well well educated time mistreated complain even ounce comparison roll wa age person son etc sorry long message anyone talk sometimes wish kept diary one day maybe mom understand going know somethings wrong wish knew something maybe finally peace,ever since wa little knew something wa wrong mentally able express emotion clearly effectively whatsoever growing mainly effected wa pretty shy kid small friend group always feared insecurity mine fast forward high school college effect became stronger mental health always one well school parent always assumed smart set high expectation like parent would high school dealt grade test score college admission college dealt grade getting internship eventually preparing career problem consider smart view expectation bit unreasonable everyone know around want much motivation work towards success expected feel lazy physically rather mentally mom constantly complains every little action mistake make really ha toll mind heart know want think right push towards success reality pushing dark hole depression sleep night want wake deal issue night finally someone talk able clear mind think fact alone time happy guess tired everyone thinking good reality hurting past spoken family regarding depressive state seems like act like conversation never happened know anymore everyday wake follow command parent go sleep longer friend finding impossible get job graduated college mom get mad showing attitude feel bad quietly lay bed temporarily forget demon eating away mind family well well educated time mistreated complain even ounce comparison roll wa age person son etc sorry long message anyone talk sometimes wish kept diary one day maybe mom understand going know somethings wrong wish knew something maybe finally peace

But at the same time, I’m hopeful. Maybe I can get a good career and create happiness for myself. Travel alone. Get pets. Read books. Volunteer. Help others.

"don't know where to go. don't really have any friends. trying to blow off some steam. lots of swearing and bad grammar.

past few days have been pretty shit. actually i've been having a pretty shit time since June. i think I might have relapsed into depression. maybe my meds stopped working, which sucks, because i'm really not looking forward to trying new medications all over again.

anyways past few days have been especially shit. i think it started when I stumbled over a short tik tok of a blooper for some Norwegian show. It was painstakingly adorable and it punched a hole through my chest because all i've ever wanted in my life was to feel like i meant something to someone. its really fucking stupid but I saved it and I keep thinking about it and it makes me feel terrible but i watch it anyways because im some sort of emotional masochist.

my family is more dysfunctional than the jackson fucking five so I dont talk to my mum or my sister. i live with my dad and stepmum who makes a constant effort to remind me i'm not welcome in her house. i said '""love you"" to my fuckbuddy of two years by complete accident (my uber was outside and i was leaving and its just what I say out of habit when I leave my dog at home) and hes been distant since.

i've been talking with a counselor the past few months but this time round it feels completely useless because I've already heard everything shes got to say since my first 3 counselors said it almost three years ago. I went to the gym today already in a pissy mood and it just got worse because I got frustrated I wasn't feeling my exercises correctly. i count my calories and I have an eating disorder. also my body image is completely shot to the point where I get more depressed every time I look in the mirror or look down at myself. i have a really stupid compulsion to spend the next week in my room and completely starve myself but past experiences have revealed to me it only leads to a day or two of binge eating so there's no point.

been trying to distract myself with videogames or movies or playing with my dog but none of thats working. fuck I wish I had friends. and fuck I had this really bad habit in highschool where I would daydream about fake scenarios of me and a friend I was crushing on. they were never sexual or anything I just wanted to feel warm. my imagination is pretty vivid and it was a nice form of escapism but ultimately it was more destructive than anything because fantasy worlds like that really just made me more dissatisfied with reality. since grad we havent said a word to eachother. don't really have any social media to reconnect with any of them. but shit I wish I just had a hand to hold. 

been thinking about getting back on a dating app or something but that's another recipe for disaster. besides I don't really have the confidence in myself right now to feel the least bit attractive and i'm not going to bait matches or whatever to feed my nonexistant ego. still. a friend would be nice. and shit I hate being so whiny all and I hate complaining. Im self aware enough to realize im not in the right headspace right now to think rationally. and when that happens, I often talk myself into corners to exacerbate a feeling of helplessness. I've seen it in others and i've observed it in myself. Its the kind of impenetrable mood that is too stubborn to resist rational advice and I genuinely feel bad for any psychiatrist or counselor who has to put up with these kinds of moods all the time.

fuck i feel pathetic. I need to cry but its just not happening. i honestly thought I was over this. I had two amazing years without major depression but now its creeping back into my life and i'm just sick of it more than anything else. i want to be loved the way I know i'm capable of loving. i want to kiss somebody in public and laugh and smile and just for once feel like somebody is going to miss me if I leave. That's the fucking worst of it. It's having those thoughts telling yourself about how much better the world would be without you and listing off all the lives that would improve if you just never existed in the first place. But it's all bullshit and I just need to remind myself that it's lies. all of it is lies. 

It's going to get better. probably. i mean I have been good before, so it's not like it can't happen again. and you know what, I still got a lot of years ahead of me. I still have university to look forward to, and statistically speaking there is a very low chance that I never meet someone and die alone. Well I don't really know the statistics, and i'm afraid if I google it it's going to be depressing so i'm just going to stay optimistic. ignorance is bliss right so fuck it. and if not i can always

One issue that i am facing for many years is this: A new group! I get close with them and after a while i start feeling like they pick on me. A little fight with anyone would make me stop me from talking to that person.
So this incident happened today :

I recently moved to canada and I have had this  kinda attraction towards a guy whom i thought liked me. He gave me mixed signals. At times he is so good with me but doesnt really seem like he is gona say anything. So last day he went and bought a jacket for himself but we friends had already planned to go by weekend. He got it beforehand. I was sarcastically pulling his leg saying that we others would go on weekend amd will not ask him to come. Today while we were planning, he told one of the other guys that he is also coming to which again i sarcastically said ""no! We aren't taking you"". He replied in a very rude manner ""who the fuck are you to say what i should do!"". I got really sad and pissed at the same time. Provided i had a tiny crush towards him now everything is gone. And i also felt like he hates me for some reason may be he doesnt. But i felt out of place and got the hell outta there. Now i know i would keep myself out from that group bcoz of this incident. Which seems very silly but i dont know what the fuck is wrong with me..
People.domt really get me and i eventually have problems with everyone. Nobody really likes me in the end. What's wrong with me. I am a good human being. I love people with all my heart.

"And this isn’t just how I’m perceiving things. I rationally can understand that what I’m doing is unhealthy and toxic behaviour. 

But at the end of each day I’m just so exhausted from having to be at work, outside, and around people that I’m can’t help but just implode. When I have days off to myself I spend the day either high, crying or high and crying. 

So I’ll get in to bed with my boyfriend each night and I’d say a good 2 or 3 /7 of the nights I’ll cry myself to sleep with him. 

I’m so exhausted constantly. And it’s spilling out over on to other people to a point that I can’t even contain. It’s like my body is just on auto pilot and I just have to watch it happen. 

Not in a voiding myself or responsibility kind of way but in a way in which I am hiccuping and gagging from uncontrollable sobbing.

"I'm not diagnosed with depression or anything, as my therapist has yet to diagnose me with anything. So I don't know what's wrong with me. 

I just have no passion for anything. I recently quit my job because I hated it, now I'm looking for something new but nothing even looks like it'll be half enjoyable. I don't want to spend 1/3 of my day hating my life. 

Not even anime, video games, or Dungeons and Dragons make me feel better anymore. I'm overwhelmed with choices when it comes to games and anime, as whenever I start something I lose any sort of motivation and quickly move on to something else, and the cycle continues. DND was my creative outlet, making a fantasy world for my college friends to play in, but apparently I'm just not that good at it anymore. My friends give advice and constructive criticism but I just can't find the energy to keep doing it. The only video game I consistently play is League of Legends, which I'm bad at, worst of my friend group. Yet I still play, and still do bad, and I don't improve. 

I've just got, nothing. I've tried religion and while I'm still a believer of Christ, I just don't feel better. I can't get invested in a series or anything so I basically just watch random YouTube videos and play League all day in between taking care of my family's dogs and doing chores. I don't feel like I have a future, or even a present. My life hit a brick wall ever since I graduated college nearly a year ago, and I've felt like I'm just declining more and more. I'd never harm myself, but I still feel terrible a lot of the time. I don't know what to do, I'm totally lost. I don't have talent or drive or inspiration anymore.

"So recently I've had an appointment with my local mental health clinic where we ended up talking about a longer stationary therapy. In the week before that my mood was generally better than usual and when I distracted myself with memes and video games I could laugh about it too. Since then my mood has remained prety much the same except for the occasional bad phases and I don't know what caused this. 


I feel like I'm gaslighting everyone from my friends to the doctors even though I know that I definitely went through months of self isolation, self harm and wishing to die. I'm scared people will think I'm just faking it because I'm doing good now. I even doubt if things ever were really bad even though a friend who has experience with depression and with whom I share a lot reassures me that those doubts can be normal. But if I actually had problems that bad why do I feel so alright now? I want these doubts to go away. It feels like my head is trying to manipulate me into denying myself help again. But I just can't take myself seriously right now, I feel like a overdramatic liar.

"TW// physical and sexual abuse
I’ve been progressively getting more and more scared of physical contact, or sometimes not even contact. Just people being too close or friendly. And I feel like why is it getting worse now. Or maybe it was always this bad and I’m so stupid I forgot.
I don’t remember being scared of physical contact when I was young.
Although, there were times growing up when my parents would physically harm me. One moment I remember distinctly is my dad grabbing me by the throat and choking me before slamming my head into the wall, and then swatting at my head a couple times afterwards. I still panic when I think about it. But I do know that I deserved it regardless.
When I was about 15 I dated a girl who was a bit older than me. I’ve always had low sex drive, and not much sexual interest. I just never really cared about it, and didn’t want much to do with it. She was the opposite. She wouldn’t really let me say no and I was forced into doing a lot of things I just really, really didn’t want to. Even in public I was forced. I felt like a slab of meat for her and I feel disgusting. She would also hit me a fair amount, though not as bad as my dad did. It wasn’t as much of an issue but I still developed an instinctive flinch at even the slightest things because of it. I know I wasn’t like that before. But now any sudden movements I get so instinctively scared and prepare myself to get hit.
I think maybe that’s why I start to have a panic attack when others touch me. But that was so long ago. Why is it at that point now where even a simple fist bump makes me panic? Or I freeze up when someone extends their hand for a handshake? Or hell, even when people sit next to me or are close I get scared and uncomfortable and panic.

"Most of the time I feel very much different from everyone and everything I do is usually not normal and my decisions of being kind and always helping others no matter what seem too naive or fake I don’t care anymore because I came to a realization that most of the people I have met so far in life are super selfish and aren’t really worth anything to me as I don’t see anyone around me have any principles of being respectful of others and just minding their own business.I truly believe that people like me if they do exist don’t fit in this world and that this world doesn’t deserve me. I want to always understand and I always try to act a different way so I can be like everyone so I don’t end up alone so I don’t feel like a loser or below anyone. I try to bring something good into this world to make myself happy but I end up letting people hurt me and use me without even realizing it, maybe I am too naive but I don’t understand why won’t people see that when someone is being kind to you and they open their heart to you why can’t you just trust them and do the same, is it really a me problem?

"I might not be a bad person. I might not be stupid. I might not be lazy. I might not be disgusting. 

But I feel like I am. I really do feel like I am. And it's ruining my life. Because it makes me hate me. It's the worst kind of shame, the shame so deep you wish you could hide it from yourself. That shame where you're so much more disappointed in yourself then anyone else could ever be. That shame where you're just waiting for everyone else around you to finally figure out how broken you are and then leave you or hate you. So you hide what you can but you know some day they'll see.

A lot of people  on here post, that they're sad because of their life, or the people around them, or the world. But, that's not me. My life is better then I deserve, people are kinder to me then I deserve, the world, although pretty fucked up, treats me way better than it treats just about anyone else. Everything about my life is amazing, except for me. Anyone else, literally anyone else, could make a happy life out of what I have. But I can't. Because I am the only common thing to all of my problems. I am what's broken. 

And no matter how much I kick and scream and cry I never change. It's like I don't want to be better.

That's the real reason why I want to kill myself. It's to prove to me that I was never okay being the failure that I am. That even if I knew I'd never get better, that I'd never fix myself, that I wasn't going to let another day go by being so much less than the person I wish I was. But as is, it's like I secretly want to be who I am. And that makes me more ashamed than anything else. 

I'd never kill myself, because of my family. But I hate this feeling so much. How can I be better? How can I fix myself when I am the problem?",1,might bad person might stupid might lazy might disgusting feel like really feel like ruining life make hate worst kind shame shame deep wish could hide shame much disappointed anyone else could ever shame waiting everyone else around finally figure broken leave hate hide know day see lot people post sad life people around world life better deserve people kinder deserve world although pretty fucked treat way better treat anyone else everything life amazing except anyone else literally anyone else could make happy life common thing problem broken matter much kick scream cry never change like want better real reason want kill prove wa never okay failure even knew never get better never fix going let another day go much le person wish wa like secretly want make ashamed anything else never kill family hate feeling much better fix problem,might bad person might stupid might lazy might disgusting feel like really feel like ruining life make hate worst kind shame shame deep wish could hide shame much disappointed anyone else could ever shame waiting everyone else around finally figure broken leave hate hide know day see lot people post sad life people around world life better deserve people kinder deserve world although pretty fucked treat way better treat anyone else everything life amazing except anyone else literally anyone else could make happy life common thing problem broken matter much kick scream cry never change like want better real reason want kill prove wa never okay failure even knew never get better never fix going let another day go much le person wish wa like secretly want make ashamed anything else never kill family hate feeling much better fix problem
"I have a pretty normal lifestyle and my family, friends, and others think I'm doing pretty well for myself. I wake up, workout, work, sleep and all that jazz but I feel like it's a facade. More and more things are also popping up that are throwing me off of my routine too which is just making it worse.

Honestly, I'm not even sure what's going on. I feel like I have personal failures and I'm also worried about the general future. I'm seeing prices going up, gas becoming more expensive, and all that and I'm worried I won't be able to keep up the lifestyle I wanted for myself once I leave the nest. Maybe it's temporary or it's not, but this is the worst I've felt in a long time and every day I wake up feeling even worse. I've been pretty good at hiding it for a while now but some of my closer friends and family are starting to pick up on the fact that I'm not feeling as ""normal""

Not sure if I should let this ""run it's course"" or try to seek help. But the issue with therapy is that my parents don't really believe in it (they've been through a lot worse than me at my age and they came out fine - so they think I can do the same). I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm on a collision course and my anxiety just keeps building up.

Please be honest with me and don't just answer blindingly yes, I know that for most cases therapy and meds could help the person get some relief but that doesn't imply they made full recovery

Sometimes depression can progress and take from you many things like your spark your personality your sense of humor your emotions even your libido and it can also cause erectile dysfunction and loss of morning woods and sometimes can even blunt your response to recreational drugs such that you don't feel high from taking them

I had ""regular"" depression for a long time and recently ( around two years ago ) it progressed into this

So my question is it really possible to make full recovery from this state ? Do you know people that had their depression become this severe did they recovery ? Do you know some studies on this matter ?

The only thing that’s worse than feeling low is admitting to other people how low you really feel.. it just makes it feel that much more real. I know I should be the one to admit to others how I really feel but you always hope that people will notice the changes in you, the warnings, the signs. And when no one does.. it just makes everything .. bad. I think what makes it so hard to talk to people about how you feel is you just don’t want them to feel the hurt and emptiness that you feel. I know people would care but why would I want to burden other people with my problems, I mean they’re my problems right? Sometimes all I wish for is for one person to talk to that truly understands how I feel and what I’ve been going through since I’ve been a kid. I’ve always felt like I was hard to love, I’ve tried changing myself time and time again to fit into what other people would want. I’ve done this for so long I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’ve always felt this way growing up so the thought of who I was going to be and who I could become never crossed my mind. Why would someone like me actually become someone other than who I’ve always been? I’ve never felt like I’ve deserved greatness, happiness, joy, excitement. I’ll make other people think that I think that but isn’t that what everyone expects you to think of yourself? I’ve always felt like a temporary person and I feel like I deserve it. So when people want out of my life, I just let them without a worry because why do I deserve love, friendship or anyone’s time? I always think why am I still even here? Of course I’m scared to die but there’s other people who’s lives have been taken so early in life and they’re great people who would of done great things. Why should I still be around but not others who actually want to be here, have goals, families, friends, loved ones. I know I shouldn’t look at it that way but it’s just so hard, I feel like other people could of been so much more than I could ever be. The worst is when you have those good days where you feel like you actually matter and like you could actually do something with your life but then you’re reminded of all the fucked up self sabotage and those positive feelings go away, just like that.. They say medicines can help you but who wants to live having to rely on something that just seems like a false reality, a security blanket. Why can’t I just be normal and live a normal life like everyone else? Why can’t I have amazing fulfilling relationships, careers, life goals and actually feel like I deserve it? Feeling like this at such a young age just makes you feel like your some broken toy that should of been tossed a long time ago. I wouldn’t wish this feeling on anyone, if you can even call this a feeling. It’s more like emptiness. Yes the sadness does come but once it’s gone it’s replaced by an empty hole in the middle of your chest. I’d rather feel the sadness than nothing at all. This pure emptiness that is more like a black hole, nothing no one can say or do can fill it, it just goes right through you. No one should even feel responsible for making me feel better, I’m the one that feels this way, I’m the one that’s broken. Other people shouldn’t have to fix me. I don’t think anyone would be able to fix me. You can feel better for so long, at least somewhat normal but it always comes back. Everything is always just a quick fix and you always know in the back of your mind you’re broken. I wish more than anything that I wasn’t broken.",1,one share want feel alone anymore sorry lot 10 22 thing worse feeling low admitting people low really feel make feel much real know one admit others really feel always hope people notice change warning sign one doe make everything bad think make hard talk people feel want feel hurt emptiness feel know people would care would want burden people problem mean problem right sometimes wish one person talk truly understands feel going since kid always felt like wa hard love tried changing time time fit people would want done long feel like even know anymore always felt way growing thought wa going could become never crossed mind would someone like actually become someone always never felt like deserved greatness happiness joy excitement make people think think everyone expects think always felt like temporary person feel like deserve people want life let without worry deserve love friendship anyone time always think still even course scared die people life taken early life great people would done great thing still around others actually want goal family friend loved one know look way hard feel like people could much could ever worst good day feel like actually matter like could actually something life reminded fucked self sabotage positive feeling go away like say medicine help want live rely something seems like false reality security blanket normal live normal life like everyone else amazing fulfilling relationship career life goal actually feel like deserve feeling like young age make feel like broken toy tossed long time ago wish feeling anyone even call feeling like emptiness yes sadness doe come gone replaced empty hole middle chest rather feel sadness nothing pure emptiness like black hole nothing one say fill go right one even feel responsible making feel better one feel way one broken people fix think anyone would able fix feel better long least somewhat normal always come back everything always quick fix always know back mind broken wish anything broken,one share want feel alone anymore sorry lot 10 22 thing worse feeling low admitting people low really feel make feel much real know one admit others really feel always hope people notice change warning sign one doe make everything bad think make hard talk people feel want feel hurt emptiness feel know people would care would want burden people problem mean problem right sometimes wish one person talk truly understands feel going since kid always felt like wa hard love tried changing time time fit people would want done long feel like even know anymore always felt way growing thought wa going could become never crossed mind would someone like actually become someone always never felt like deserved greatness happiness joy excitement make people think think everyone expects think always felt like temporary person feel like deserve people want life let without worry deserve love friendship anyone time always think still even course scared die people life taken early life great people would done great thing still around others actually want goal family friend loved one know look way hard feel like people could much could ever worst good day feel like actually matter like could actually something life reminded fucked self sabotage positive feeling go away like say medicine help want live rely something seems like false reality security blanket normal live normal life like everyone else amazing fulfilling relationship career life goal actually feel like deserve feeling like young age make feel like broken toy tossed long time ago wish feeling anyone even call feeling like emptiness yes sadness doe come gone replaced empty hole middle chest rather feel sadness nothing pure emptiness like black hole nothing one say fill go right one even feel responsible making feel better one feel way one broken people fix think anyone would able fix feel better long least somewhat normal always come back everything always quick fix always know back mind broken wish anything broken
"OK, so many years of Mobbing and Bullying gave me social anxiety and many more problems. And I wanna get rid of them.

I often see or hear about others writing via WA, meeting in their free time, doing stuff. And every time that happens I ask myself: who would this person be in my life? And I never find anyone. Don't get me wrong, I have friends, I'm just not very close with them.

And the more I think about it, the more I see that I need such a person in my life. But how do I get anyone from just friends to really close friends?
Another thing is, that I'm a guy and many of my friends are girls, so it always feels like asking for a date (or they might feel like this), even though that's not at all what I want.

"I just turned 35. I've never felt more confronted by anything than the days leading up to my 35th birthday. I've internalized so much of my true feelings that I don't think anyone knows who I really am or how I really feel. I'm not sure even I know who I really am. I think the thing that has been most striking for me is that I can't figure out anymore if the person responsible for my childhood trauma is me or the characters that were around me. I know some people might turn around and say that I shouldn't blame myself etc, but it's nothing like that. I really seriously don't know if the person who pushed the first domino was me or not. And I feel like I need to know, and I don't even know why.

"Hello. I have very bad depression and anxiety, and recently it just feels like everything is falling apart. Three months ago i started a job i really like, but it just seems like everything in life is going wrong. My car is unreliable so I've missed work or have been late several times. Then recently found out my grandmother has cancer and we're very close. When i found out, at first it didn't effect me much but then after I visited her after i got the news I just completely shut down. I couldn't sleep and then when I did sleep, I slept all day. I didn't go to work, i would wait to tell them til the middle of the day. Then i just stayed shut down, i just didn't care about what happened. Thankfully my job has been very understanding lately, but last night I had a panic attack. I could have sworn I was having a heart attack, you couldn't tell me otherwise. So i went to the er and didn't get home until 6am, the drugs they gave me completely knocked me out and i was out all day and missed work. I feel like I'm trying but it just seems like something is always going wrong and im at a loss.

"Sorry for the woeful little rant

I'm watching myself spiral down into a life I thought I would never live. An existence that's already beginning and it starts with addiction. I'm completely aware of it and it terrifies me so I need to numb it but that only furthers one of the many problems. For the past year I've felt I had more incommon with the screaming drug addicts than most ""normal"" people. When I walk into a store I can feel people looking at me because it's obvious I'm homeless. I have this self destructive part of me that's way to strong to ever let me have a happy, normal life. It makes me wanna die before I have to watch myself become something that would make my mother cry or kill me before I can do it myself. 

I surprisingly started looking for a job the other day just for kicks and haven't gotten a reply back. I'm not even sure why I did. I can't get a job with the way I am now, the way I look and all the problems I have to carry.

"Hi. Im using a burner.

I dont know what to do. I want to cease to exist because I am such a disgrace. I think such awful things about myself and I dont trust anyone. When I was a kid i was molested by some family members. Later on I was preyed on by an older teacher. I just feel like a used dirty whore and a whiny bitch for even complaining about it. Im stupid and forgetful and a mess. I know that i have people that care about me, I cant do this to them, I know that they would be hurt, but i dont know if they would be hurt because they actually loved ME because I dont know who they think I am becuase Im so damn confusing all the damn time. i read into things and give tiny shit more power than it deserves.

My partner is very put together and doesnt really understand things that have to do with emotion and not logic and it is really hard i don think that they understand or ever will. They really want to but they just cant.  They dont even really like to talk about it with me or maybe i dont feel comfortable talking about it with them, but they are so wonderful that leaving them would be the worst mistake of my life. I wish i could either be better or could never have existed at all. My family would be better off because I wouldnt be burdening them, i never would have been there to tempt my family members even though i know it isnt my fault, is it?

"It used to be that when I fell into suicidal thoughts any sort of action was purely impulsive. It was just like “oh knife? what if we just slit a wrist or two.” But I’ve been stuck in one of these for a month or so now and I haven’t had any impulsivity but I’m planning now. I tried to find some prescriptions in the medicine cabinet but my parents hid them after my last attempt. I’ve thought about cutting but I’m not exactly a fan of blood and that kind of pain isn’t something I’d ever be interested in. Kinda started to resort to hanging even though it can be… messy. I feel like it might be faster and more accessible than an OD at this point. As for timeframe I’m kinda lost. I wanted to be gone by today if I’m being honest but I’m in marching band and we’re going to semi state. I know I’m important to that show so I’m not doing it now. I assume we’re not making state so I’m thinking that night or maybe the next day is my best bet.

I’m so sick of everything. I’ve reached out. I’ve tried to self admit to psych wards and I’m always sent away. Reason?? There isn’t one. I’ve never been given a reason for being sent away. My parents don’t believe in depression and actually blamed my impulsive suicide attempt on hormones. Yep!! Hormones. As if those should make one want to kill themselves.

So we’ll see where I’m at. Semi state is next week.

"So…. 
The world has been dark and depressed for me in 2 months, since I stopped drinking. 
I get flash backs of my life. And the flash backs and thoughts are about to make me drink again… 

I have been through things, in my life. And It is weighing me down. 
The things I use to do, the behaviour, I had I changed “for the better” but now I can’t handle to carry it on my own. That is why I write it here. 

First of all. English is not my foregin language. 
Second of all……the things that makes me rotten from the inside: 

Since I was little my parents were not the best parents. They were perfect from the outside. But inside they always put me as a subject in their fights, my dad has always got this sexual look on my ass, boobs, comments, always walking around in underwear. I remember something with sleeping and “spooning” as a little girl. It is terrible.
More darkness is my mom send me to a doctor, and he put his fingers up in me to do a check. I MEAN WHAT WORLD IS THIS. It was a procedure etc etc but I would (if I had) NEVER send my little girl to a male 50 year old doctor to get his fingers up in her to a rutine check if everything is okay at puberty. It makes me feel like my mom is this society zombie and I just carry the weight of everyone sexuals demons. 
The third thing that hunts me is.
When I got older, I got into some bad things myself obviously, and I learned a couple to know. Let’s call them Lisa and Eric. I was 18 they were maybe 24 etc and they wanted to do a threesome with them, I ended up doing it some time after. And ended up more far out from this new situations with drugs sex etc. Years later we go on a vacation together. And Eric was always trying to hit on me also behind Lisa’s back. Times after times I rejected. But I fall in. And on the stairs up to a hotel room. He (I am sorry for sexual language I do not hope minor is reading this) but he / we end up doing something not good….. years(1-2) later again we are on drugs (stupid ofcourse) i tell her it. What happend on the vacation. Because I am not like that. He flips out, denying. (We are all 3 sitting at a table). She gets mad at me and do not wanna be friends anymore. They are married and have been in together in a long time still a young couple though…Lisa ended up sending me home in a taxi.. and eww it was a really really really a gross feeling. — hope this story is to understand

I feel like locking myself in a dark room. I feel like my soul inside me is hard like a rock. So heavy.

It is my past etc but I am currently at my parents to visit them because I can’t and will not cut them out of my life.
But the world feels so cruel? The world I had my foot in, so dark . And my guilt too.

Any second thoughts to this? Or someone who knows how to cope with it?

"Hi I just wanted to vent for a bit.. 👉🏼👈🏼 You don't need to comment anything.


These past two years I've been feeling so goddamn exhausted. I have no energy left in me to do anything and I just.. I wish I was able to take some kind of break but all my school work keeps piling up and I keep having exams after exams. Recently I've been failing my exams or just barely passing them. I'm in highschool right now and we're having this super important exam that's kinda important if I want to get in a good college. The thing is, it's hard to even get out of bed to study when all I want to do is sleep and never get up. I'm mentally and physically exhausted all the time and I keep having breakdowns because I'm just so freaking tired and disgusted of myself, of who I've become. I'm so unsure what I want to do with my life.. Or if I even want to live. 

I pushed everyone out of my life so I don't even have any friend irl to talk to. My mom constantly puts me down so I don't even talk much to her anymore.. And my dad never understands my emotions, and constantly tells me to just ""deal with it"" or ""get over it"". I hate how unlovable I am tbh. I hate how I keep disappointing everyone. Hell, I even disappoint myself almost everyday. Everyone seems to leave me and I just.. I wish I didn't have to worry so much about these things and I didn't have to deal with reality. It's too much for me.

"I’ve come to the conclusion, depression has ruined my life. It’s not over and I’m aware of that, I’m only 22. However my suffering has led to deep isolation. My friends don’t understand it’s not their fault I don’t talk with them much. I’ve tried for a few years now and I can’t keep myself on a steady basis of talking to anyone. I’m married, and I have been a whole year now. My husband was super extroverted, and now he’s just not. I think this is my fault. Through me he’s discovered that he too suffers from depression. He never understood why he had certain behaviors that are obvious signs of depression. He never understood why he just loses motivation in things he loved, and now he does. He’s become more introverted, even losing contact with some of his friends. I’m scared I’m ruining his life too.

He lost his father to cancer right before me, while I was being abused by someone my parents considered family.

I sometimes wonder if all the pain we’ve both experienced is the reason we connect so much. If maybe all of this culminated, and we closed ourselves off to the world.

"everything is getting worse, not just depression, but my eating disorder too, and my urges to self harm

I feel awful all the time and there's nothing I can do about except get drunk or self harm (not like I can get drunk often anyway since I'm 16 and my parents never leave the house)

I can't even distract myself anymore, and I'm pretty sure most of my friends are tired of my venting but they wont admit it

I don't know what to do anymore I can't even get therapy because my parents dont take my mental health seriously no matter what I say or do.

"I used to get bullied in middle school and this barred me from ever joining any social events. I turned into the class clown, who graduated with literally no friends. This all made my social skills deteriorate and I'm just starting over and still can't get things right at the age of 20.

So far at college I've been belittled for the embarrassing shit I do all the time. Been exploited. Been led on. Been sexually assaulted. Heck, I've even allowed myself to talk to creepy strangers. I've been a literal doormat.

And I must say it was all my fault for being such a gullible person. I never held any self-respect for myself. I put everyone on a pedestal over myself and thought about people who never cared about me. I mistook close friends (some I had online) for best friends. I mistook acquaintances for close friends.

I've just realised now that if I were to cut anyone out for the sake of self-respect, I'd be left with almost no one. There's no way that everyone is normally an asshole. It's my fault I've been attracting this and accepting this treatment for too long.

I have no idea idea how often I would try to ""start from scratch"" to screw things up again only to go back to hiding from the public. I hate being spotted in public. **I fucking hate my name. I fucking hate my image. I fucking hate myself.**

I just wish someone was out there going through the same thing and help each other figure our way out into becoming a part of society. I'm so alone in this.

"I can't fucking do this anymore. Everything is piling up and my family isn't helping they make me feel like my problems aren't important and call me spoiled. My mom doesn't know how to deal with me so she just tossed me into a psychologist and therapist and my dad thinks mental illness is just in your head. So many things are stressing me out it feels like my world is crumbling I'm losing hope for my future I feel like I am a lazy failure and I want to end it all but I'm too much of a coward to actually do it. I cant feel happy anymore it's been three years. I try so hard to be happy in front of my friends but deep down I'm so sad that it physically hurts my body. It feels like a constant punch to the gut. I've never felt anything like this.

I want to talk to my closest friends, the one that I actually made a connection to, there are two of them and I love them so fucking much, but I feel like I annoy them enough already. I think I've hit my lowest. And I normally have this light in me that, even when I feel like this, was excited about the future and knows I have potential, but now it's gone. I can't feel anything except when I listen to music which just makes me cry so I can get my tears out. I used to be so happy and cheerful but now it's just a facade. Nothing makes me feel happy anymore. Not even the music that normally lifts me up. It's like a drug. The moment I stop listening to it, the feeling comes back and I can't escape it.

"I am 20M university student and I don’t believe that I should exist anymore. I was supposed to take an online exam right now. I couldn’t just do it. I looked at the questions and waited for a time then I quit. 

I was supposed to work for that exam until that moment and I couldn’t because 
I have no friends
I have social anxiety which is killing me. I can’t even open my camera on zoom. Let alone talking to a girl.

I literally have no one beside my parents who are questioning my social life.

I lie then that I have friends and all but....

I daydream all the time that I have friends and I work with them hang out with them fuck with them. 

There isn’t an academic life ahead of me cause I daydream, I am shy and  I can’t break this cycle which is going to go forever. 

I want to move away from my family. I want to go to an another country. I don’t want to see my acquaintances, my family. I don’t want them to see me fail more and more. I don’t want them to call me. 

I want to work as a slave in another country. 12 hours a day minimum wage I don’t care. I just can’t keep up with this world.

I start sobbing when I see people’s Instagram stories and how they do things together. I am mental.

There isn’t literally one thing that can make me happy

"Hey there fellow redditors, I need to vent. This might be a long post so thanks in advance if you took the time to read. I'm a 22 y/o student. Three months ago I broke up with my gf, we were together for almost 7 years. It was a good break up, we are in good terms and everything was okay. For a while I was real sad, felt like nobody would ever like me and that I might die alone, like a month ago I met this girl and we really hit it off. She is Amazing, she's really pretty, cool, etc. Pretty much all I wanted, we both like each other and we are going through that phase. So in terms of having someone I'm doing great. Also, I got a job in my university that pays well and it's super fun and enjoyable. I'm also exercising and stuff. Basically, everything was looking up. I've been off coke for about two years now. I have some cool friends. Etc. You might say well sounds good bro but it ain't. Yesterday I was in bed with my new girl and I couldn't perform, I'm extremely anxious and not getting a strong erection made me spiral and things went south, she was really okay with it and everything seemed fine but inside my head I'm a mess. This problem with getting an erection ain't new but this time it hitted me hard and here I am now, I feel like I don't deserve happiness and I'm considering killing myself. I know it might seem abrupt but I have a history of anxiety and depression, I was treated for anxiety with quetiapine but I stopped taking it. I don't now what to do, who to ask for help, what to do about my fucking ED problem, I'm so young yet I feel like my fucking life is over and that I should not be alive. I feel bad for her because I wanna give her the world but I'm fucking trash. I really wanna die and Don't know what to do. My biggest concern is that even when things were looking so good in my life it felt like everything was coming together and not being able to perform sexually for the girl I'm dating has me spiraling so bad I'm seriously thinking about taking my life.

We are not alone in this and it's taken me years to learn that and it most definitely helps.,1,19f really feeling lately started college month ago much optimism enthusiasm made one friend stuck rut everyday feel trying tell normal usually get way around end year hard sending love anyone feel alone taken year learn definitely help,19f really feeling lately started college month ago much optimism enthusiasm made one friend stuck rut everyday feel trying tell normal usually get way around end year hard sending love anyone feel alone taken year learn definitely help
Over the last few months I've been catching him staring at my chest or butt and sometimes he will peek on me getting dressed or in the shower. I didn't really think it's an issue but recently hes been touching my chest and I found out that he does stuff to me while I'm sleeping.

"I've been really struggling to get through life recently.
I feel powerless. Completely lacking control over how it looks like, and what I would like it to be. I have almost everything a happy person should have, according to some western consumerist agenda. I'm from a well-off family, going to a private high school, well-educated, priviledged and never suffered of paucity in my life. It doesn't change anything, and I still regret to wake up in the mornings. What's the reason behind this is unimportant right now. Sure, it's about my family problems, and a huge history of mental illnesses in it as well. 
I feel like whatever I would like to enjoy in life is automatically the hardest for me to achieve. By far, the most important one is finding love. I spend my whole days dreaming of real love and support, and being able to give it so someone else as well. I was in a few relationships, although never met someone who could reciprocate my determination. I am very busy with my school, which at the moment feels like a labour camp (I didn't know just how competitive it was when I signed up). Having someone with whom I could be emotional and caring would be a single thing to make life worthwhile at the moment. I feel like all of my goals and positive outlooks on the future are worth nothing, if done by myself alone. 

That being said, I found redemption in nihilism. See, I like someone. I've wanted to open up to her about my feelings for a long time. I know she views the world quite simmilarily to me (and yeah, is also depressed which doesn't make my interest any lesser), and that she has qualities no other person I know has. I've been dying inside trying to hold my feelings, because I was so scared that if I get rejected, there will be nothing to hold on to left. Yesterday, I had a thought - I reminded myself about nihilists, and the idea of utter absurd of being alive. The thought that it all has no meaning suddenly made sense. It wasn't only a philosophical tantrum, but rather a cheerful revelation. I felt free, first time for a very long time. Life no longer made any sense and my dreams, goals and a desperste instinct to hold on to whatever I considered valuable in this world wasn't important, finally. I decided that if my role in life is only to exist, and that it's not going to change, or get any worse than this, that I might as well show the girl my feelings. I invited her to a prom - not stating I like her explicitly, but making sure it's quite obvious I do. I'm awaiting her answer, but I now feel as if a huge load has been taken off my back. I've been trying to hold on to my narrow area of confort for so long that now, doing something petrifying, going against my instinct and every bodily sensation felt like I took control of my life back, at least for a moment. 

I don't know what will happen next, but now at least I know what's the right way to live. It's reaching out to what you desire, no matter how hard it might be. Otherwise, it's going to be easy for the existential dread to catch you, and no distraction will ease the feeling you should be living your life in a different way.

It's the learned hopelessness that's the worst in depression. A belief that you know how you would like to live, but firmly rejecting the possibility you could be living it. For a person like me, I will do anything that will seem logical to me. I've been struggling to find any logic behind trying to live the life I want to, but now I can see it. It's that you can't tell yourself life is shit if you haven't actually proven it to yourself by doing brave things. It's also that doing the brave things can feel so empowering itself. It's that when you finally start to make things into what you would like them to be, suddenly you may notice the chirping of the birds, and the beautiful morning sun striking trees in a park. Life won't feel like a chore if you force it to be closer to what you want it to be. Eventually, it might turn out your life isn't a chore at all. And if it will still be that, well, then at least it didn't get any worse, because you already hit rock bottom.",1,really struggling get life recently feel powerless completely lacking control look like would like almost everything happy person according western consumerist agenda well family going private high school well educated priviledged never suffered paucity life change anything still regret wake morning reason behind unimportant right sure family problem huge history mental illness well feel like whatever would like enjoy life automatically hardest achieve far important one finding love spend whole day dreaming real love support able give someone else well wa relationship although never met someone could reciprocate determination busy school moment feel like labour camp know competitive wa signed someone could emotional caring would single thing make life worthwhile moment feel like goal positive outlook future worth nothing done alone said found redemption nihilism see like someone wanted open feeling long time know view world quite simmilarily yeah also depressed make interest lesser ha quality person know ha dying inside trying hold feeling wa scared get rejected nothing hold left yesterday thought reminded nihilist idea utter absurd alive thought ha meaning suddenly made sense philosophical tantrum rather cheerful revelation felt free first time long time life longer made sense dream goal desperste instinct hold whatever considered valuable world important finally decided role life exist going change get worse might well show girl feeling invited prom stating like explicitly making sure quite obvious awaiting answer feel huge load ha taken back trying hold narrow area confort long something petrifying going instinct every bodily sensation felt like took control life back least moment know happen next least know right way live reaching desire matter hard might otherwise going easy existential dread catch distraction ease feeling living life different way learned hopelessness worst depression belief know would like live firmly rejecting possibility could living person like anything seem logical struggling find logic behind trying live life want see tell life shit actually proven brave thing also brave thing feel empowering finally start make thing would like suddenly may notice chirping bird beautiful morning sun striking tree park life feel like chore force closer want eventually might turn life chore still well least get worse already hit rock bottom,really struggling get life recently feel powerless completely lacking control look like would like almost everything happy person according western consumerist agenda well family going private high school well educated priviledged never suffered paucity life change anything still regret wake morning reason behind unimportant right sure family problem huge history mental illness well feel like whatever would like enjoy life automatically hardest achieve far important one finding love spend whole day dreaming real love support able give someone else well wa relationship although never met someone could reciprocate determination busy school moment feel like labour camp know competitive wa signed someone could emotional caring would single thing make life worthwhile moment feel like goal positive outlook future worth nothing done alone said found redemption nihilism see like someone wanted open feeling long time know view world quite simmilarily yeah also depressed make interest lesser ha quality person know ha dying inside trying hold feeling wa scared get rejected nothing hold left yesterday thought reminded nihilist idea utter absurd alive thought ha meaning suddenly made sense philosophical tantrum rather cheerful revelation felt free first time long time life longer made sense dream goal desperste instinct hold whatever considered valuable world important finally decided role life exist going change get worse might well show girl feeling invited prom stating like explicitly making sure quite obvious awaiting answer feel huge load ha taken back trying hold narrow area confort long something petrifying going instinct every bodily sensation felt like took control life back least moment know happen next least know right way live reaching desire matter hard might otherwise going easy existential dread catch distraction ease feeling living life different way learned hopelessness worst depression belief know would like live firmly rejecting possibility could living person like anything seem logical struggling find logic behind trying live life want see tell life shit actually proven brave thing also brave thing feel empowering finally start make thing would like suddenly may notice chirping bird beautiful morning sun striking tree park life feel like chore force closer want eventually might turn life chore still well least get worse already hit rock bottom
"My entire life I've been anxious. Since I was a baby with seperation anxiety or a young child having to go to therapy for social anxiety.

For as long as I can remember I've been soul crushingly lazy. Living in a disgusting mess my entire life. Being underweight my entire life because I am too lazy to get food.

I'm on 150mg of Zoloft for the past 5 months and it has helped with my anxiety but I hate the side effects and I still rarely leave my room.

I have tried everything- having a friend force me to clean, reading self help books, therapy, meds, trying to build up discipline and never giving up on ""fixing myself"" for my entire life.

I was smart- good at school and had hope for myself but after so so long I realize I'll never be normal. I will never be able to deal with the real world.

Nothing motivates me. I dont want love, a family or career success. Im not sad. I just dont see how anyone can tolerate basic life. I dont see the point. 

Im not suicidal. Im only 17 and im scared to graduate and deal with having actual responsibility.

"I started dating my GF in late december 2020, i was 22 she was 19. I had been suffering with depression since about the age of 13/14, probably due to issues regarding adhd. I was diagnosed with adhd in january this year and titrated 3 different medications for it from march to june, to no avail. They had no noticeable effect. Me and my Psychiatrist decided it'd be best i deal with my depression first as being depressed, having no job or routine wasn't ideal for titarting adhd medication. So i started setraline in june. It was going very well, i felt better than i ever had. Until mid September, the day i had my second covid vaccine was also the day i went upto 200mg sertraline daily. I went to the gym that evening and i felt so weak and lightheaded and nauseous, i kept tripping and wasn't with it. Then i was ill for a few days i guess from the vaccine, but my mental state never recovered.

Fast forward to the last week and once again i started having intrusive and obsessive thoughts like i used too. Me and my gf were lying in bed talking about the first night we slept in bed together and how we slept nude, she talked about how i didn't sleep and i was like well duh i had never slept with a girl before let alone nude. And she said she was just out like a light, which made me think maybe it wasn't so special for her then. I asked her if she had slept nude with anyone before ie her ex. And she said yes and then well no, i haven't been topless because I've never shown anyone my boobs and body. But it didn't matter anyway, now i was just imaging her in bed with him. We went to sleep. The night after she was saying she wants a new bed as hers is kinda old and broken and i asked how long she had it and she said like 4 years, and i just felt sick, that she had shared this bed with someone else. It had never crossed my mind but now it had it wouldn't leave. Now every time she mentions sex I just imagine her and him at it, i someone times think about asking what position they did it in if she never showed him her boobs.

The thing that gets me is that she hated him, they went out for 1 and a half years, but she didn't even like him. She said he always smoked weed which she hated and he made her cry all the time. Her parents hated him and wanted her to break up with him after like a week. He ended up cheating on her with a guy, he was gay or bi at least. 

She is 3 years younger than me, i was 22 when i lost my v card to her. I had opportunities to lose it when i was younger with 3 or 4 people, but i wasn't that into them that i could commit to a relationship and i didn't want sex with someone i wasn't in a relationship with. I think about these things i did for the first time with her and then i realise it wasn't her first time, yadda yadda it was her first time with me. But idk sleeping with and having sex with someone i don't like is kinda weird to me. She said she was with him because she was lonely and he was someone to hang out with. Idk just makes me feel sick she had sex with someone else, i know its a normal thing. But ofc as long as i have known her it has been just us 2, that happened before i knew her. But it happened. She calls me her soul mate but idk if i feel the same. Of course i know it's rediculous, but i just feel like i saved myself all this time for someone i really liked but she just had sex with some douche she didn't like",1,started dating gf late december 2020 wa 22 wa 19 suffering depression since age 13 14 probably due issue regarding adhd wa diagnosed adhd january year titrated 3 different medication march june avail noticeable effect psychiatrist decided best deal depression first depressed job routine ideal titarting adhd medication started setraline june wa going well felt better ever mid september day second covid vaccine wa also day went upto 200mg sertraline daily went gym evening felt weak lightheaded nauseous kept tripping wa ill day guess vaccine mental state never recovered fast forward last week started intrusive obsessive thought like used gf lying bed talking first night slept bed together slept nude talked sleep wa like well duh never slept girl let alone nude said wa like light made think maybe special asked slept nude anyone ie ex said yes well topless never shown anyone boob body matter anyway wa imaging bed went sleep night wa saying want new bed kinda old broken asked long said like 4 year felt sick shared bed someone else never crossed mind leave every time mention sex imagine someone time think asking position never showed boob thing get hated went 1 half year even like said always smoked weed hated made cry time parent hated wanted break like week ended cheating guy wa gay bi least 3 year younger wa 22 lost v card opportunity lose wa younger 3 4 people could commit relationship want sex someone relationship think thing first time realise first time yadda yadda wa first time idk sleeping sex someone like kinda weird said wa wa lonely wa someone hang idk make feel sick sex someone else know normal thing ofc long known ha u 2 happened knew happened call soul mate idk feel course know rediculous feel like saved time someone really liked sex douche like,started dating gf late december 2020 wa 22 wa 19 suffering depression since age 13 14 probably due issue regarding adhd wa diagnosed adhd january year titrated 3 different medication march june avail noticeable effect psychiatrist decided best deal depression first depressed job routine ideal titarting adhd medication started setraline june wa going well felt better ever mid september day second covid vaccine wa also day went upto 200mg sertraline daily went gym evening felt weak lightheaded nauseous kept tripping wa ill day guess vaccine mental state never recovered fast forward last week started intrusive obsessive thought like used gf lying bed talking first night slept bed together slept nude talked sleep wa like well duh never slept girl let alone nude said wa like light made think maybe special asked slept nude anyone ie ex said yes well topless never shown anyone boob body matter anyway wa imaging bed went sleep night wa saying want new bed kinda old broken asked long said like 4 year felt sick shared bed someone else never crossed mind leave every time mention sex imagine someone time think asking position never showed boob thing get hated went 1 half year even like said always smoked weed hated made cry time parent hated wanted break like week ended cheating guy wa gay bi least 3 year younger wa 22 lost v card opportunity lose wa younger 3 4 people could commit relationship want sex someone relationship think thing first time realise first time yadda yadda wa first time idk sleeping sex someone like kinda weird said wa wa lonely wa someone hang idk make feel sick sex someone else know normal thing ofc long known ha u 2 happened knew happened call soul mate idk feel course know rediculous feel like saved time someone really liked sex douche like

"I'm 23 (F) yo. I live in Mexico so the fact that I'm living in a 3rd world country is not helping.

I had have depression since I remember. I have a very bad relationship with my mother, my parents are divorced and my mom and I are very similar physically and in personality so I think she hates me for that reason, she sees herself in my like a mirror. She never let me be myself and she always punished me, with physical violence or humiliation. I was 18 yo and I was at high school when I decided to leave home and move out with my boyfriend. I thought that been independent from my household will resolve the problems but I just faced the reality of adult life and absurd capitalism.

My boyfriend is not a bad person itself, but he's very immature for his age (30 yo) he doesn't know how to administre money so I became the provider of my house. That wasn't bad on 2019, I was a supervisor at my old job, but then this COVID shit happened and my life was in declive.

I lost my job as supervisor and my debt start increasing. I don't have the way to earn more money. I changed three times my job, the last one was a callcenter for US customers and I never the felt more like shit, people was rude as hell and everyday I cried in my room, but I needed the money because nobody is going to help me with my problems. My boyfriend never helps to pay the bills but I really hated that job so I decided to quit my job and open a nail salon.

Bad idea. I cannot deal with the anxiety, I don't have a single customer yet and I don't know how I am going to pay the bills at the end of this month. I know that if I apply for another call center I'm going to be hired very quick but I don't want to feel that I'm only useful for a shitty job like that and deal with stupid Karens all the time.

I am tired of dreaming and realize that is not possible and everything is about the damn money. I had to dropout high school to leave my toxic family and then work hard to get a nice life but everything is going worse, I just wanted to finish my education, have an own business and maybe in the future study college in Turkey, my dream country. But I'm just done, I don't want to try nothing more. I cannot even afford therapy or antidepressants.

I just asked my boyfriend to end the relationship and once he leaves, I am going to kill myself. I don't feel sorry for anyone. I haven't spoke with my family since four years, I know that my boyfriend is not attracted for me anymore, and my friends are not close enough, nobody is going to miss me. I just hope someone can take care of my cats.

I just wanna end the suffering of my debt, my low self-esteem, my loneliness and depression.

I don't know if I'm going to hang myself, take pills or jump from my apartment. I don't even have a gun.

"Sometimes I think about whether I am actually depressed or I’m making all of this up. As a heads up, I have been clinically diagnosed. But, what if becoming irritated very quickly is just my personality? What if I actually have anger issues? What if sleeping too much or too little is just…. normal? Sleeping too much to the point my friends have noticed and asked me about it, lol. What if those times where I don’t have the motivation to get out of bed, brush my teeth, shower, change clothes, or anything hygienic is just me being purposely disgusting and dirty and unhygienic? What if me not seeing any future for me except failure is literally what everyone else is thinking? What if isolating myself for weeks and months and not even answering my phone or wanting to go back home and lay down and be alone is, normal? Maybe I’m just an introvert. What if being really harsh on myself is normal? What if wanting to die is normal? What if my drastic changes in appetite are normal? I go from feeling fine to feeling like shit like day and night, what if that is normal?? What if this constant feeling of hopelessness and self deprecation is normal? What if I actually don’t feel any of those things and my brain is playing tricks on me? What if I’m just trying to convince myself I do or don’t need help depending on how I feel? What if I’m just lazy? What if I don’t have anything actually going for me in my future? What if constantly pushing people away is just who I am? What if me wanting but not being able to actually pursue an actual relationship in my 20 years of life because I am not comfortable with someone getting to know me in fear that they will not like the person I actually am, and that they will betray me and leave me…. that they will hate my body, my personality, everything about me like I do…. is a normal fear that everyone has and I’m just being a pussy about it. What if everyone more times than not replays and cannot let go of the past, and feels guilty for everything? For every little mistake. What if my lack of concentration is normal? What if me not feeling present, just alive going through the motions of life, not feeling like a person is normal? What if my body feeling heavy, like I have to drag myself and have to breathe harder to feel like I am breathing is normal? What if I am making all of this up so that I can get help that I don’t even need? And even then, I always find an excuse never to go to therapy because that would make it all real.

"Looking back at my childhood, as early as ten I was very depressed. Didn't cut my hair for years, split ends like crazy. I would put it in a bun and keep it that way for four or more days, not washing or brushing.

I'd wear the same bra for a month or two, I'd wear the same panties for three or four days normally, but there were times where it's end up being a week. I didn't get changed, if going out meant I had to change out of my pajamas, I simply wouldn't go. I'd also wear the same pair of flip flops everywhere, I didn't like wearing shoes that needed socks because I always fell back into a cycle of wearing the same pair of socks for weeks.

Every night I would stay up until 6-7am laying awake in bed, I was diagnosed with insomnia. Life was loopy, I had terrible sleep deprivation, if it got so bad I struggled to walk without passing out or falling, I also had hallucinations frequently that further induced the fear I already had (CPTSD)

Why didn't anybody say anything, noone tried to help me in any way at all. I was popular all throughout my childhood, but I never had any friends.

"So here we go life is like (at least for me) a game where everyone is forced to play of course some are better at the game than others and the ones that are bad at said game are forced to keep playing because everyone is forced to play and if they are able to press the power button on it then it makes their trials and tribulations through the game pointless which displays their desire to maintain their position/have an opportunity to elevate themselves rather than to help others elevate their positions. Thus we are stuck at an impass where people are forced to suffer not due to the unavailability of resources but rather a hope that everyone has that THEY will one day reign supreme. Ah just replace the ""game"" with life and the ""power button"" as death.

"I’m a 28 y/o female and I feel completely frozen and stuck in life and in myself. 

When I was younger, around 21, I was in a drastically different state of mind. I knew my value, I had goals and dreams, life felt full of possibilities and excitement. The world was my oyster. I was motivated, almost on a high type feeling. In terms of how I felt about myself and my outlook on life, it was the best I’ve ever felt.

Now I’m older and I’ve achieved many of the goals I set (I’m self employed doing the job I always wanted, bought a house with an incredibly loving and supportive partner, a dog, I can drive and have my own car)… what a lovely story, right?

BUT … I feel completely flat, empty and I’m badly depressed, have no motivation to get up or even shower. I don’t know who I am or what I want, I dread waking up in the morning and having to do ‘life’ again for another day. It’s actually killing me on the inside. I feel like I’m rotting away.

How on earth do I get back the mindset of my younger self? I’ve tried setting myself new goals, like ‘run 5k’ or ‘eat healthy’ or ‘save x amount of money’ but they all feel so futile, boring and pointless. I don’t feel connected to them at all. They just feel like things I *should* be doing.

Even this week I feel like I don't have the power nor the need to do anything and just lay there under the sheets not even eating or looking at the phone just stay in bed under the sheets

Are there people that have some techniques or tips on what to do on days like that ?",1,hi depressed year ago little little recovered started getting track forcing something sometimes happens really mood feel like hitting even want nothing want lay sheet even week feel like power need anything lay sheet even eating looking phone stay bed sheet people technique tip day like,hi depressed year ago little little recovered started getting track forcing something sometimes happens really mood feel like hitting even want nothing want lay sheet even week feel like power need anything lay sheet even eating looking phone stay bed sheet people technique tip day like
"I enthusiastically love learning various languages and I've been doing this since 9 years and now! I study multiple languages and even being clinically depressed since 2 years, I somehow manage to study all these everyday. Before that, my passion was drawing and sketching, which seems already dead 2 years ago!

I dropped out of engineering and started to pursue my passion in the Japanese language as a degree course 2 years ago, first year was fine, but ever since we all had started to stay at home because of covid, now I'm severely depressed regarding this language study! Nothing ispires me anymore in the Japanese language or culture, there's no motivation for it! It just feels so dry and boring, forceful and mundane by studying (online classes) through the university as a 3 years degree course! I force myself daily to study it for getting good grades, passing the exams and getting the degree, coz apart from that, I totally have lost the genuine passion in it that I had 2 years ago! This even isn't the way I learn languages or practice them, but I've no other choice but to obtain the degree so anyways I'm doing it! Beside it, my passion for other languages haven't gone, they're still alive...

SO, HOW DO I OVERCOME IT? ANY TIPS, TRICKS?

"I made a youtube video as a bit of a cry for help. while it acclimated 52 views only around 1 or 2 people even bothered to watch the whole thing. That's partially on me. I don't know anything about editing and it was largely unscripted. I did multiple takes and tried to make it as coherent as possible. But It doesn't look like many people cared.

I already talked at length on this account about some of the reasons I'm depressed. I don't have many friends. The few ones I do have I barely see anymore, I've lost something pretty important to me, and I feel like an abject failure. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm afraid that my pain will be forgotten. The only reason I'm not dead is because it hurts to drown or hang yourself. It's surprisingly easy to die on accident but hard to die on perpouse. I just want people to listen,  people to understand me. I know I'm an Idiot.

"Not really all here at the moment. Kinda broken. Hearts in a vice so sorry if you don't understand much. I've been ringing around for help for around 2 months but no help yet. I recently left forces after later finding out that they've done me dirty and didn't help me the way I needed it. This has been going on years and I'm just trying to find some happiness. Relationship is slowly dying too. She might be pregnant but we dunno yet and we argue but I'm just giving up and giving her everything now. Anything she wants she can have I just can't handle the pain. I'm just trying to love her but it's silly little mistakes and problems getting in the way. She makes me happy when I can see her. Jobless too but I'm trying on that front. Got an interview today so fingers crossed. I'm trying to be good but honestly I can work out, look clean, get a job, and drive. I know I can look the part and be a handsome guy but inside I want to fucking die and wish some horrid disease or car or anything would just swallow me up... I'm losing what happiness I have left and it wasn't much to start with.

Can someone give me a hug please?

Cont: can't get out of bed. Writing this to make me actually do it. I got an interview in 3 ish hours. I gotta move. Gotta do it for my potential kid. It doesn't matter how I feel. I wanna die.... Thats all that's going through my head.

Cont: just about to do the interview... God I hope this goes right. Please just something go OK for me today please. Please....

Cont: I got a second interview. Thank christ for a win. My gf is still being distant but Ive done something cute and sent her a rose with an apology. I think we're OK and she's just had a long day but my minds racing and I can't concentrate. This feeling will not fuck off. I'm doing things correct right? Am I being a fucking dick? I just want a bit of love you know.... Instead I feel like death.

Cont: so she's broke all contact with me... She took the pill and she might not be pregnant. I don't know if she is but doubt she is. I dunno. I'm all alone again.... I confided in a friend and he's helping but my hearts broken. My head is still being squeezed by that dark cloud but I'm trying guys. I'm really really trying....

"Over the last couple of years since my early separation from the Air Force, I’ve been struggling mightily to pull myself out of whatever rut I’m stuck in. Whenever I seem to go a few months without feeling like complete shit about myself, that feeling just keeps crawling back. 

I’m thankful to still be employed during this whole pandemic thing, but my family telling me that I could do better than what I’m doing now makes me feel even worse about myself, that I’m not good enough. My dad’s favorite line for a while has been “You should be further along in life than you are right now” like I don’t already know that. 

Another thing that reinforces my feeling of worthlessness is the fact that I’ve been ghosted by a couple women I had strong interest in, for one reason or another. I’d be lying if I said I was consistent on my meds, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I scared at least one of them. The other I feel straight-up used me so that I can take their foster cat off their hands (she’s not going anywhere; I’d be far worse than I am now without her, which is saying something). 

Idk why I’m even writing this. I just feel so alone right now and I fucking hate it. All I want to do is just hide in my apartment and just not deal with anyone anymore. And yet, I’m craving a relationship so badly that it only makes it worse. I know I have to start loving myself a little more, but how can I do that when I’m just a washed up airman with little to no interest in most things these days?

"For the past 7 or so years I have held back all my pain and hurt and hidden away every single tear of mine with a smile and a chuckle. I can't even go to my parents for help as I have a weird relationship with them. I love them, but I don't want to involve then in anything important in my life as they have let me down time and time again by ignoring my opinions. And neither do I have any friends I can open up to. 

7 years of holding back every single tear and sniffle has ended up with me just wanting to cry once. I just want to cry to someone in my life, just so that someone, anyone in my life can just know what I'm going through and how everytime I wake up I think of killing myself and everytime I go to sleep I can't stop hating myself. I can't cry, I have always thought of what I'd do if someone was next to me and willing to listen, I literally dont know, I think I would just stay quiet and maybe just walk off. I guess unless they like hug me or something there's no way I could cry XD.

This past summer, I was full of hope and energy to meet people. I had access to alcohol (I’m 21) and went to bars and clubs and met new friends. However, I had health problems and other serious causes that led me to use alcohol to forget the “pain.” Always felt crappy the next day, so I stopped getting near to blacking out every time I drink or just took breaks because I couldn’t help myself. 

Since the school year started for me (I’m a finance student), I have been extremely stressed out. School sucks and I feel like the friends that I am with that I have been friends with since freshman year aren’t the same anymore. It’s the same old crap we do and talk about and I want something more and new. This guy that I’m talking to asked me what my interests were and I couldn’t tell him one thing. All I do is sleep, work, study, then hangout with friends and him. I feel so embarrassed that I have nothing interesting going on besides going to bars and clubs. Nothing special about me. 

I also often talk about death and how amazing it would be if I just die. I’m not suicidal but I talk about death as if it’s casual talk. Am I depressed? I really have no motivation in doing anything unless I’m really really supposed to do it.

Please help me.",1,past summer wa full hope energy meet people access alcohol 21 went bar club met new friend however health problem serious cause led use alcohol forget pain always felt crappy next day stopped getting near blacking every time drink took break help since school year started finance student extremely stressed school suck feel like friend friend since freshman year anymore old crap talk want something new guy talking asked interest tell one thing sleep work study hangout friend feel embarrassed nothing interesting going besides going bar club nothing special also often talk death amazing would die suicidal talk death casual talk depressed really motivation anything unless really really supposed please help,past summer wa full hope energy meet people access alcohol 21 went bar club met new friend however health problem serious cause led use alcohol forget pain always felt crappy next day stopped getting near blacking every time drink took break help since school year started finance student extremely stressed school suck feel like friend friend since freshman year anymore old crap talk want something new guy talking asked interest tell one thing sleep work study hangout friend feel embarrassed nothing interesting going besides going bar club nothing special also often talk death amazing would die suicidal talk death casual talk depressed really motivation anything unless really really supposed please help
"I’m 18. For the past 2-2.5 yrs I’ve been thinking about ending my life. This thought used to be a rare occurrence initially but now I’m at a point where I’m thinking about it every single day. Living feels very painful. I keep crying every single day. I have no one I can talk to. I have not seen a therapist. I simply don’t have any motivation, sometimes not even enough for me to be able to fill my water bottle. The period between 2018-2020 was very stressful for me, I was preparing for some standardised college entrance tests. I was somewhat a cheerful teen at the beginning of 2018, optimistic, ambitious, motivated. By the end of 2019 i was a total mess. There were times when I’d be standing in the balcony looking down wanting to jump off but  the thought of there being a chance of me surviving a fall from the 4th floor prevented me from doing that and I also hoped that if I got into a good college my life would take a 180 and all of these feelings would simply disappear. I did manage to get into a very good college, I’m right now a sophomore but things have only gotten worse. I’m unable to find any sort of happiness. I can’t do anything. Im weak, useless, pathetic. I hate myself. I don’t have any friends. I go out for cycling sometimes, I pass a canal on the way. It’s deep enough to end my pain. I’ve read it takes about 5 mins for someone to die by drowning. I can take that. But I don’t think my mom can accept losing me. I don’t want to hurt her. At the same time I’m done trying. I’ve tried very hard. I did everything I could to make the people around me proud, happy. Im just done now. Don’t have any ambitions, hate everything, can’t do anything. I don’t understand why do I even exist. I wish I could gift my life to someone who was not fortunate enough. I scream for help in my bedroom every single night, nobody answers my call. Feeling very helpless. Unable to find hope. I’ve hinted my parents about how I’m feeling but they haven’t caught on. The 15 yr old me would fail to recognise me. I’d be thankful for any sort of help.

I make posts on here, I reach out actively. I try my best to make friends, I’m in no means an introvert but, I was born the wrong colour, with the wrong face. I have what o want and I’m not starving. I’m not doing to bad in regards to finances but I feel so empty.

I think I felt the most empty the day I realized my brothers were gone forever. The two people who ALWAYS wanted to see me or talk to me. Now I’m just alone hoping anyone will give me the chance to be something to them. 

I am suicidal but Reddit is the only place I’ll tell, because I’ve tried in the past and as time passes I’ll eventually make sure it works. I don’t even have someone to leave my things to. I have everything and yet nothing. Money and all the at really don’t make a person happy.

"Had a nasty bout with COVID in July (was down and out for about 3 weeks with 9 days in my IMCU having pulse ox as low as 70). I’ve slowly been bouncing back but it’s been HARD to say the least.

In the weeks &amp; months following my release from the hospital, it’s been an EXHAUSTING experience getting back to work (I’m currently an audit contractor for a Big 4 CPA firm). I don’t draw a salary (hourly only) nor do I have the capacity to deal with the disability mess (not like they’d pay out enough to cover my mandatory expenses as far as I can tell). Missing those 3 weeks (plus another week due to a pneumothorax a few weeks later) had a nasty impact on my household financial status. Not to mention the medical bills from those two hospitalizations are coming in and are not pretty (yes, I had insurance, thankfully, but my payment responsibility for those two hospitalizations is very high regardless).

On top of all that, I found out yesterday that my daughter has been diagnosed with ASD (meaning both her AND my son in on the spectrum and am struggling to figure out our plan to address those challenges).

I had a nasty depressive episode in mid 2019 (due to an accumulation of years of various personal &amp; professional challenges and my upbringing issues never being resolved properly) and was on 20MG Escitalopram and seeing a weekly therapist until I felt stable enough to handle life without both. Things seemed to have been moving okay even with a few more bumps until the infection. Now, things feel like a giant mess that won’t stop piling on.

I’m constantly exhausted, feel weak all the time, prone to having exaggerated symptoms from something like a simple cold (apparently due to my body already working overtime from the COVID infection), can’t concentrate at work for long periods of time (thus affecting my overall work quality), and on top of all that having to juggle the responsibilities of two autistic kids while my wife is pushing through her studies (she’s done next May but having to basically isolate her from the kids so she can study uninterrupted is yet another thing to pile on).

I’m inclined to conclude that all these issues have triggered another episode (as familiar depressive symptoms are showing) but how would I honestly be able to tell for sure?

"Within the last year I've finally gotten on a regimen of medications and therapy that really help me out.  I actually went about four months with almost no depression at all and only mild-to-moderate anxiety.

What I've noticed over the last month/month and a half is that the shorter the days become the more depressed I become.  But, unlike how it used to be, it doesn't linger all day.  I'm depressed when I awaken, I work through it for 2-4 hours and it lightens up, then about an hour or two before the sun sets it increases quite a bit again.

It's really messing with me because, previously, my depression has pretty much been all-or-nothing.  It's always either been there constantly or, as in the case of the new medications, pretty much gone.  It's really frustrating and disappointing to work through it in the morning and then have it come back at me at the end of the day.

Also:  It doesn't matter what time I go to sleep/wake up.  It's still there.  I've noticed that I tend to go to bed earlier at night (8:00-8:30 PM) just to get an extra couple hours of daylight in the morning.  I still have to fight through the initial post-awakening depression though.

Note:  For almost all of my life I've loved the shorter days/longer nights, colder weather, etc. that come with Autumn and Winter, so this is really taking me by surprise!",1,within last year finally gotten regimen medication therapy really help actually went four month almost depression mild moderate anxiety noticed last month month half shorter day become depressed become unlike used linger day depressed awaken work 2 4 hour lightens hour two sun set increase quite bit really messing previously depression ha pretty much nothing always either constantly case new medication pretty much gone really frustrating disappointing work morning come back end day also matter time go sleep wake still noticed tend go bed earlier night 8 00 8 30 pm get extra couple hour daylight morning still fight initial post awakening depression though note almost life loved shorter day longer night colder weather etc come autumn winter really taking surprise,within last year finally gotten regimen medication therapy really help actually went four month almost depression mild moderate anxiety noticed last month month half shorter day become depressed become unlike used linger day depressed awaken work 2 4 hour lightens hour two sun set increase quite bit really messing previously depression ha pretty much nothing always either constantly case new medication pretty much gone really frustrating disappointing work morning come back end day also matter time go sleep wake still noticed tend go bed earlier night 8 00 8 30 pm get extra couple hour daylight morning still fight initial post awakening depression though note almost life loved shorter day longer night colder weather etc come autumn winter really taking surprise
"In the 80’s Reagan infamously cut funding off to mental hospitals and literally pushed people out onto streets with nothing but robes on. 

Since then the only way you can get inpatient mental hospital care is if you say you want activity kill someone or yourself. Even then once in they do everything they can to get you out ASAP.

It’s a pitiful horrible system. I have serious anxiety issues that cause fainting when I try to go out and do things. Also have severe depression from not being able to have any social life or a job. So course I’m poor as hell and on social security at 40. 

Trying to just find a place to live with the money you get it’s next to impossible. Only reason I’m not homeless is I pay $80 less than the going rate because my LL sees a steady tenant is better than people in and out constantly.

But this place is awful. Electrical issues. More spiders than you can imagine. Bad ant issues. 

There should be affordable apartments that are clean, quiet and affordable. People suffering from mental illness shoulsnt end up homeless. It’s such a horrible existence. No wonder suicide ends up looking like such a good out. If I end up homeless with these issues I really don’t have the fight in me.

We spend incredible amounts on defense. If we xut that by 5% we could care for the mentally ill.",1,80 reagan infamously cut funding mental hospital literally pushed people onto street nothing robe since way get inpatient mental hospital care say want activity kill someone even everything get asap pitiful horrible system serious anxiety issue cause fainting try go thing also severe depression able social life job course poor hell social security 40 trying find place live money get next impossible reason homeless pay 80 le going rate see steady tenant better people constantly place awful electrical issue spider imagine bad ant issue affordable apartment clean quiet affordable people suffering mental illness shoulsnt end homeless horrible existence wonder suicide end looking like good end homeless issue really fight spend incredible amount defense xut 5 could care mentally ill,80 reagan infamously cut funding mental hospital literally pushed people onto street nothing robe since way get inpatient mental hospital care say want activity kill someone even everything get asap pitiful horrible system serious anxiety issue cause fainting try go thing also severe depression able social life job course poor hell social security 40 trying find place live money get next impossible reason homeless pay 80 le going rate see steady tenant better people constantly place awful electrical issue spider imagine bad ant issue affordable apartment clean quiet affordable people suffering mental illness shoulsnt end homeless horrible existence wonder suicide end looking like good end homeless issue really fight spend incredible amount defense xut 5 could care mentally ill

5 months ago my girlfriend left me coz she had asked me to write a review about a certain café on a website, doing that would get her club some extra money, so i copied the review of someone else and sent her a screenshot, as i wanted her to study more on her studies, i wanted her to plan out on her future goals rather than being merry in the present and not giving a daumn about the future, she thought i was treating her like a burden.

"Well the question is the following, I do not know why we as men's feel horny from nowhere or the need to generate children in our subconscious throughout our lives.  

The problem is that this disrupts the daily routine and breaks even the cycle of studies or goals to be achieved during the month.  

I feel a lot of difference in relation to hot and cold climates, on hot days it only tends to get worse.  While in cold climates it is quieter not to feel horny.  

Is this all somehow more instinctive in our subconscious to maintain the human species?  

What's the best balance to no fap for a month and in six months ? 

What physical or mental work do you use to not think about the need to masturbate or fuck someone and focus on your daily routine? 

What do you do to improve your self-esteem and become more agile during the day?

"About five months ago, I was diagnosed with psychotic depression.  I wasn't eating, I had accusatory voices in my head and delusions.  I lost total interest in life, and I wanted to end it.  I felt like I was dead.  I quit my job before this happened.

Since then I've been on medication, and I'm doing better, but I still have lost interest in life.  I don't want to work for the rest of my life, but I'm not enjoying life as it is either.  There's nothing for me to wake up for.  Every single day feels the same.  I just sit in my room, and I think.  I feel apathetic, and the medication makes me feel numb.  I don't care about entertainment anymore, and I feel alone, but I have trouble talking to anyone.  I still don't want to be alive.

"I've been taking Wellbutrin in combo with Adderall for about 4 months. I'm past the well known honeymoon phase of Wellbutrin and believe this is my baseline on both of these drugs. 450mg of Wellbutrin (broken up into one morning dose and one afternoon dose) is doing wonders for my motivation and energy levels. My adderall dosage is 10mg IR in the morning and 5mg IR in the afternoon.

The issue that I'm running into is that I've noticed that I'm getting into **bad** moods. For the past month I've been a really shitty combination of sad as fuck and easily angered. For example, I've been extra sensitive when my SO says something that hurts my feelings and instead of forgiving and forgetting like I normally do, I start a fight about it. I've also been getting really depressing intrusive thoughts and I cry more frequently.

Could anyone tell me if they or someone that they know has had this problem with these medications, and if so, what has helped you?",1,taking wellbutrin combo adderall 4 month past well known honeymoon phase wellbutrin believe baseline drug 450mg wellbutrin broken one morning dose one afternoon dose wonder motivation energy level adderall dosage 10mg ir morning 5mg ir afternoon issue running noticed getting bad mood past month really shitty combination sad fuck easily angered example extra sensitive say something hurt feeling instead forgiving forgetting like normally start fight also getting really depressing intrusive thought cry frequently could anyone tell someone know ha problem medication ha helped,taking wellbutrin combo adderall 4 month past well known honeymoon phase wellbutrin believe baseline drug 450mg wellbutrin broken one morning dose one afternoon dose wonder motivation energy level adderall dosage 10mg ir morning 5mg ir afternoon issue running noticed getting bad mood past month really shitty combination sad fuck easily angered example extra sensitive say something hurt feeling instead forgiving forgetting like normally start fight also getting really depressing intrusive thought cry frequently could anyone tell someone know ha problem medication ha helped
"It doesn't matter how much I am trying to be a good person. Daughter. Sister. Friend. Woman. Soul. It doesn't matter. I will be always picked apart to the skeleton and told I am doing a bad job. I am doing the best I can, I swear. But no matter how hard I try. No matter how awful I feel and how much my body hurts and how sick my heart is. I am not doing enough. Aparently I am lazy. I am mean. I am not trying hard enough. Why aren't you smiling? When will everything be done? You are wrong. You should try some more. This is done, it took hours, right? But those things aren't done so let's not focus on what you did right, but what you didn't manage to do. Not doing enough. And others? They are busy. Tired. I have to understand how much they have going on, right? They didn't mean what they said - they just snapped. Everyone snaps sometimes, right? Just not you. You should try harder. Bad bad girl. Down on your knees and ask to be forgiven. Others are unhappy and they just don't have the capacity, but you should know better. When I am not lying in the hospital with my heart literally broken (a heart disease) I am just not enough, no matter what I do. And those scars? I dunno. I guess I am trying to get attention right? It can't be that I am broken, on the edge of killing myself and literally just staying alive because I love my family to which I am not fucking enough. 

I am never enough to anyone. No matter how tolerant, open, hard-working or thoughtful I am. That is just not enough. Thanks for keeping open space for improvement for me. I almost thought I am doing a fine job, but you guys know I can push myself just a little further before I jump off of a cliff right? Right? When I can't stay unhealthily positive anymore because my manic episode ends, everyone acts so surprised I haven't seen such faces on a surprise birthday party even. 

I can't do this anymore. I am just trapped here fantasizing about suicide at least once a week. And all those things you make a big deal about... people have real problems you dicks. Stop. Fucking. Yelling. At. Me. You are yelling because I cooked for you and you didn't hear me telling you there's a food on the stove. Literally. I am the worst. What a fucking monster. I dared to cook a dinner for you. What a terrible daughter. Should I punish myself? No need. You did it already. 

I know you're frustrated. I know you work really hard to put food on our table. I am sorry I can't squeeze so much more out of myself. I would like to work harder. But I really am sick. You out of all people should know the best that the last time I tried harder, I fainted and had to be in a hospital. So please, please, fucking please you guys, can't you just like try to not make me wanna kill myself? Thank you. I love you, but don't be dicks.

And stop fucking mentioning you want grandchildren. I am not your only child and you are big part of the reason I am single and without friends. Completely lonely. So how about you just fucking shut up and leave me in my room alone, having a break down.

"I am truly alone now, every bridge I had was burned either by me or the other party. I have lost all of my friends either because they didn't want to hang out out me anymore because I made them uncomfortable or because we grew apart because I don't do anything social anymore. However I still didn't consider myself fully alone until the situation with my parents.   They were the straw that broke the camel's back.

They were always condescending pricks when it came to my depression. The day I attempted suicide (and it only failed because of a dumbass oversight of mine) they became alot more empathetic and caring. I thought they had finally learned and realized how they were acting. At least that was the case until very recentely. They were acting very kind and understanding after my attempt and as the days went on they slowly morphed back to the people they used to be.

That's when I realized that they will never fucking change. If a fucking suicide attempt won't change them nothing fucking will. Now I don't talk to them at all. All I do is go to work and work the night shift and come home and lock myself in my room and rot away in my room. The 2 fucking people I thought would care are the ones that have been the worst for my health. Fuck them i hope they rot in hell.

"I just need a place to put it all out there, so I made a throwaway account for this. I have been through so much in my life, it all feels like some cruel joke. Event after event, trauma after trauma. I am officially diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, and Depression. I was getting better, I was better, but I feel like all my progress was lost as of recently. So here’s what happened: I finally moved to my dream city across the country alone with my dream college major. I was so excited to make friends here, as I haven’t been successful in the past. I could have a fresh start again. Things were great for the first few weeks. I was getting good grades, met a nice guy and started dating, made a friend, and was on almost a high. I had worked on myself for 2 years previously, and had gotten to a point to where I thought I would be okay. Then things started to slowly fall apart. I failed my first calculus test, and I worked my butt off to understand the concepts for multiple hours a day, but couldn’t figure it out. Meanwhile the guy I met who was dating me said he wasn’t into me anymore. It really hurt because I really cared about him and it was so out of the blue. He was struggling with his own depression, but refused to get help. I cut him off for a bit to heal, as his mood made me feel like I had to be the one who was okay in the relationship, even though I was most certainly not. All of my repressed feelings then spewed out following the unexpected breakup. I wanted to seek therapy again because I knew I was going back to old thinking habit, despite being on antidepressants. I had panic attacks every day because I could not figure out calculus for the life of me. I couldn’t do it anymore so I withdrew from the class and changed my major. I value my mental health over some lame college degree. 

I reconnected with my ex because I wanted to be friends again. The loneliness was becoming unbearable and I just wanted another person to talk to. I have never been friends with an ex before, and I will admit it was a difficult task to separate my old feelings and this rekindled friendship. It was much better having another person to talk to despite this. 

Meanwhile, I was starting to have intrusive thoughts about suicide, such as hoping a car would end everything and such. I knew it was the depression talking, and like I said I wanted to get therapy for this. 

Now my ex had a past of attempting suicide, and so I told him to tell me if he felt like he would do something, so I could alert the authorities. Well a few nights after becoming friends again, he said he was going to kill himself soon. I was crying and crying and I called the campus police, because I don’t want anyone to die, no one deserves to feel like they have no other options except death. I wanted him to get help and be okay, even if it was going to  cost a broken friendship and his anger. His life is more important than both of those things, plus I had told him I would have to call the authorities, so it shouldn’t have been a shock. Long story short, he blamed me for ruining his life. It has been over a week and I have yet to hear from him again. 

I went to my college’s counseling center and they said they had no more room from taking patients, so I have to get a local therapist, but I do not have a car. I have been so close to self harming again after being clean for a year and a half. My PTSD dreams are becoming more frequent and I’ve been so isolated. I now almost hope an unfortunate accident happens so I wouldn’t have to worry about anything anymore. The thing that is scary is that the lines between depressive thoughts and my actual desires are starting to become blurred. I just want help from a professional and I might not be able to because of my unusual situation. 

Tonight, I put a sharp object next to my arm and fantasized about harming myself like I did those years ago. I am terrified of what I’m becoming once again, and I can’t do anything about it it seems right away. I just want to be okay, I wasn’t supposed to be like this in the city I’ve been dreaming of living in since I was 15. I am so overwhelmed, yet I feel numb and I’m getting through each day on autopilot. I don’t want my depression to rule my life again.

"So I guess I've been hiding the fact I've been pretty depressed for a while. I've been drinking heavily burying myself in the drunken persona ive developed that for a short while it gave me comfort and made me loose all anxiety.. but also turned me into abit of a jerk, these past few months that persona has been leaking into my everyday life and I've upset quite alot of people including my girlfriend and work collegues. My spending habits have gone completely out of controll cause I'd just start buying gifts for everyone drunk plus all the booze I was consuming, started pissing the bed which I don't know why I found it it funny at the time but this has driven my girlfriend to move out, we where supposed to be buying a house but I've blown a good chunk of my deposit and it's going to be months till i recouperate the lost money, long story short I'm stopping drinking 7 days In so far but the fact I'm so lost at the moment living back at my parents with no girlfriend I've been searching for ways to self medicate. It's the time of the year magic mushrooms are growing in the UK so I thought it may be a good way to change my mental health. I dropped 2g of mushrooms at my parents and if you ever think this is a good idea don't..  I locked my self in the room and was trapped with nothing but my own spiraling thoughts I couldn't leave cause I'd have to pass my parents to get out the house so it was hours of just the worst thoughs and realisations of everything I fucked up one thought cascaded into another and it was hours of relentless mistakes coming back to haunt me that I'd been blocking out. In my prior state these thoughts where just buried deep and I wasn't taking them seriously, and my perception on my life has been completely changed.. its horrible to feel like you've hit rock bottom but I'm glad I've at least realised now instead of later, I'm trying to change by starting small and eating breakfast, next week will be organising my room, after then I'll pick something else and hopefully I can change my life for the better.",1,guess hiding fact pretty depressed drinking heavily burying drunken persona ive developed short gave comfort made loose anxiety also turned abit jerk past month persona ha leaking everyday life upset quite alot people including girlfriend work collegues spending habit gone completely controll cause start buying gift everyone drunk plus booze wa consuming started pissing bed know found funny time ha driven girlfriend move supposed buying house blown good chunk deposit going month till recouperate lost money long story short stopping drinking 7 day far fact lost moment living back parent girlfriend searching way self medicate time year magic mushroom growing uk thought may good way change mental health dropped 2g mushroom parent ever think good idea locked self room wa trapped nothing spiraling thought leave cause pas parent get house wa hour worst thoughs realisation everything fucked one thought cascaded another wa hour relentless mistake coming back haunt blocking prior state thought buried deep taking seriously perception life ha completely changed horrible feel like hit rock bottom glad least realised instead later trying change starting small eating breakfast next week organising room pick something else hopefully change life better,guess hiding fact pretty depressed drinking heavily burying drunken persona ive developed short gave comfort made loose anxiety also turned abit jerk past month persona ha leaking everyday life upset quite alot people including girlfriend work collegues spending habit gone completely controll cause start buying gift everyone drunk plus booze wa consuming started pissing bed know found funny time ha driven girlfriend move supposed buying house blown good chunk deposit going month till recouperate lost money long story short stopping drinking 7 day far fact lost moment living back parent girlfriend searching way self medicate time year magic mushroom growing uk thought may good way change mental health dropped 2g mushroom parent ever think good idea locked self room wa trapped nothing spiraling thought leave cause pas parent get house wa hour worst thoughs realisation everything fucked one thought cascaded another wa hour relentless mistake coming back haunt blocking prior state thought buried deep taking seriously perception life ha completely changed horrible feel like hit rock bottom glad least realised instead later trying change starting small eating breakfast next week organising room pick something else hopefully change life better
"I've had it easy since the day I was born. While the rest of my family was struggling, they gave me everything on a silver platter. A decent education, a roof over my head, lots of food on my plate, an easy life, endless love and affection. Hell, my poor older sister practically became my third parent. I never had to work for anything. I was never responsible for anything. I was the baby of the family and was coddled, and now I can't do a single damn thing on my own.


Everyday I think about how I constantly fuck up, how much of a disappointment I am, and how much other people deserve to be in my place instead. I can barely manage the bare minimum and I fail at that a lot of the time too. Meanwhile, my sister's hardworking, independent and resourceful and could do anything she put her mind to, and instead I'm here fucking everything up like I always do, enjoying the opportunities that she never got but deserves a hundred times more than I do.


I think about what the lives of my friends and family would be like if I were never born, quite a lot.

" I'm posting this here because this is causing a great deal of pain and frustration in my life

My parents strongly believe in being vegan and not eating animal products but I've tried explaining that's not the lifestyle I want to live by. They force this upon my whole family and little siblings.

I have my own job and make a great amount of money, so I'm able to afford my own food but they absolutely despise me doing so. It's getting to the point where I am literally starving because they don't have any real food. It's just fake proccessed shit that will make anyone vomit.

"I managed to do so much in the last year--I hit an up streak with my mood, found a goal I really wanted to work towards, and threw everything I had into accomplishing it. I started grad school, moved out of my small town and into a city I've wanted to live in for years, found a new, better paying job, found an apartment I actually like, started rebuilding my credit. I've come so incredibly far and now, I'm hitting a wall. 

I've reached that point where I've actually accomplished my goals and I should slow down and rest and appreciate what I have earned. But I literally can't. I don't know what to do with myself in the evenings. I spent so long in the mindset of ""I need to get to X"" that I have no clue what to do now that I'm at X. I feel bored and empty and alone. 

Nights are hell in that they feel like they go on forever and I can't enjoy anything that is supposed to relax me after work.  I've started drinking more, which sucks because I had cut it out almost entirely as part of my plan to improve my life. I feel like I can't enjoy my nights unless I'm getting at the bare minimum mildly tipsy (and on my own too) or at maximum, fall-over drunk. I've tried writing, reading, watching my favorite movies and shows, playing games, none of it works or makes me feel good, and I end up feeling tortured by all of these things I should enjoy but don't. 

I'm falling back into the mindset of what is the point? If I can accomplish all of my goals and still sit here every day feeling miserable, then what is the point of pushing myself at all? Why not just self-destruct? It's taking everything I have to not throw what I've built out the window because my brain cannot appreciate what I have. 

I could set a new goal, but what would be the point of that if I'm just going to feel this way once I've reached it? I need to learn how to just exist and I literally don't know how.",1,managed much last year hit streak mood found goal really wanted work towards threw everything accomplishing started grad school moved small town city wanted live year found new better paying job found apartment actually like started rebuilding credit come incredibly far hitting wall reached point actually accomplished goal slow rest appreciate earned literally know evening spent long mindset need get x clue x feel bored empty alone night hell feel like go forever enjoy anything supposed relax work started drinking suck cut almost entirely part plan improve life feel like enjoy night unless getting bare minimum mildly tipsy maximum fall drunk tried writing reading watching favorite movie show playing game none work make feel good end feeling tortured thing enjoy falling back mindset point accomplish goal still sit every day feeling miserable point pushing self destruct taking everything throw built window brain cannot appreciate could set new goal would point going feel way reached need learn exist literally know,managed much last year hit streak mood found goal really wanted work towards threw everything accomplishing started grad school moved small town city wanted live year found new better paying job found apartment actually like started rebuilding credit come incredibly far hitting wall reached point actually accomplished goal slow rest appreciate earned literally know evening spent long mindset need get x clue x feel bored empty alone night hell feel like go forever enjoy anything supposed relax work started drinking suck cut almost entirely part plan improve life feel like enjoy night unless getting bare minimum mildly tipsy maximum fall drunk tried writing reading watching favorite movie show playing game none work make feel good end feeling tortured thing enjoy falling back mindset point accomplish goal still sit every day feeling miserable point pushing self destruct taking everything throw built window brain cannot appreciate could set new goal would point going feel way reached need learn exist literally know

"I am truly alone now, every bridge I had was burned either by me or the other party.

They were always condescending pricks when it came to my depression.

I thought they had finally learned and realized how they were acting. At least that was the case until very recentely. They were acting very kind and understanding after my attempt and as the days went on they slowly morphed back to the people they used to be.

That's when I realized that they will never fucking change. If a fucking suicide attempt won't change them nothing fucking will. Now I don't talk to them at all.

"First time reddit user/Post, the only reason im posting this is because i have no one to talk too about my current sitiuation, i desperatly need some life advice and decided this might be a good place to get my voice heard.

I don’t know why im even posting this, and i doubt anyone would really care, but i just wanted to get this out there for once. i don’t even really know how to start this off. 

I give up, i don’t want to do anything anymore, i don’t know what to do with my life, i have no path or direction in which i wanna head down, no intrest in anything, i didn’t graduate highschool, and i don’t even have my GED, i’ve never been able to get a job on my own, and the only job i’ve ever had i only lasted 6 months, and within that time i felt like i was worked to the point of burn-out, or maybe i just became lazy, i don’t really know anymore, and i can’t rely or trust myself to keep me afloat anymore. Im extremely anti-social, and i would consider myself a shut-in, i’ve never had a girlfriend, but i don’t think i even deserve one.

"Something my sister recently said that honestly scared me a little bit because of how true it was. I have Major Depressive Disorder  as well as Anxiety Disorder and probably an undiagnosed PTSD. I have attempted suicide about have a half dozen times now. I have suffered a lot of childhood (and adulthood) trauma that have left me so depressed for so long that I can't remember a time where I wasn't depressed. I have always been mentally ill. I have a  persistent voice in my head that continuously tells me to hurt or kill myself.  Even the smallest inconvenience sets me over the edge. My arms are covered in self harm scars. I fantasize  about dying and hurting others and it scars me what I'm capable of. One  of my earliest memories is of a dream is falling in a flesh-like hole and watching a man being skinned alive by a monster while he begged for help. I crawled out of the hole and ran out of the hole, leaving the man to die. I remember being barely above ten when I had that dream. I feel like my entire life have been overtaken by my depression and my overwhelming need to kill myself and hurt others. My sister has hidden knives and box cutters from me. I can tell she is scared for me and been of me. I'm  not scared of death. I fear who I leave behind and how my death will effect the people I love but I look forward to dying. I'm honestly excited to experience what happens after death. I remember being excited by it even when I wasn't even a teen. I just recently turned 26 and I'm ready to die.

"As someone who has been through and continues to go through a list of awful things, many consider me to be quite strong. But there’s one thing most people don’t bother to do for the “strong” people. Many never simply ask how you are. They already know the things that are going on in your life. They already know you’re going through hell. So they don’t bother asking. As new problems arise, no one cares. Maybe they did at first when things first started going down hill. But as the list continues to go on, people stop caring. Simply because they know I’ve been through worse. They know I’m strong so they don’t bother asking about me or listening. They just simply assume I’m fine because I’ve been through so much and I can handle it. They see my fake smile and move on. But what they don’t know or understand is how much that hurts. How unloved it makes me feel. Yes, I am strong. Yes, I can handle it. But no one bothers to listen to my problems because they already know I’ll make it through. Instead I get to watch others consoled by everyone around them when just one problem arises for them. It hurts. It hurts to watch others get all this empathy when I barely get a passing glance (I of course help console them as well). Just to have someone sit and listen and show some sort of emotion seems too much anymore. Ive started to stay quiet. I’ve been shown my problems don’t matter to others. So I stay quiet. And let it eat me alive. I’m slowly feeling it harder and harder to open up to others in fear they will stop listening/caring as I am speaking just like everyone else has thus far. So quiet I will stay. And the days I lash out unintentionally or go completely silent from all this, others just get angry. I’m the strong one. I should know better. I’m expected to hold it together because I am “strong”. I’m not allowed to crack.

I try to tell her how fucked that is and she says “you never ask me for permission to do things” but I’ve literally never been able to have guests here because she lives here and she’s such a crazy bitch.

"I think a few years ago I already found the person for me but I fucked it all up and honestly it's never been the same. No person I've ever met has ever been like what it was with them. It's not like I'm still hanging on to them either, I've completely given up on that. It's just that after any relationship I feel as in I've already given all I have and feel like I don't have anything left to offer to anyone.

I have to drink just to have any actual fucking emotion these days, and that's not good for anyone. ""Why are you always drinking when you talk to me?"" Is such a devastating sentence to hear everytime, but how do you describe to someone that you are just an empty shell of a person that has no personality without the use of a substance?

I don't know. It all just seems so fucked, I live my life one day at a time but it's never for myself

"I feel undeserving of love and compassion, and I’m scared it’s gonna ruin my relationships, 

I have a hard time believing people like me, even if their words and actions indicate that they do. I have an even harder time believing someone could actually love me. I believe that they think they do, and lie to themselves because they have pity on me or used to think they’d like me before actually getting to know me 

Rationally I don’t have any reason to think that. My romantic partner, for example, treats me with a lot of care and respect, I have absolutely no reason to doubt them. But I don’t *believe* it. Because if I did I’d have to admit to myself that I don’t deserve that love and have to separate myself from them so they can find someone who does and who’s actually good enough for this person that I care about. But I don’t wanna do that cause I love them. Which in turn makes me feel like a selfish, egotistical monster that is even less deserving of kindness.

I feel like this about every relationship, (from family, to friends etc.) that I have. And I don’t know how to cope with that. I know it’s not a healthy way to think, but I also don’t Know how to get out of it. Because I genuinely am not a good person. I have a lot of flaws that I’m aware of and that other people agree with. And no one has ever been able to tell me a positive character trait of mine, or explain why they even like me. Which I understand, its true and I know I have to change. But I also feel incapable of doing that.

I know this kind of thinking is going to destroy every relationship I have because depression poisons everything. And I have no idea how to get better. How to be a better person. And if I can’t be a better person then THATS what’s going to destroy all of my relationships.

"

I get dumped about 6 months ago and the break up was extremely cruel and brutal and traumatic. 

it still feels like it happened yesterday. I cry about it multiple times a day.

On top of this I have always suffered from extreme depression and suicide. My ex was the only thing that made me even a little happy. After my partner left I felt so empty I made serious attempts at suicide several times. Tried antidepressants and all they did was make me very irritable and cognitively impaired to the point where I couldn’t think enough to do my job. 

I’ve been extremely severely depressed for months. I’ve quit trying or even doing much at work and received several warnings and the only reason I haven’t been fired is my work culture and manager is very easy going and because I work from home. I can barely function. I can barely sleep. I don’t eat much. Everything is erratic. 

Some days I’ll be okay and will just be walking and get severe attachment anxiety and will just have to go back to my car and break down into tears. 

I have disturbing thoughts of her being fucked by other men and it eats me up inside.

I want to kill myself so so so badly but I haven’t found a good way to. I feel stuck in my career and in my life. I feel stuck and I want out. I feel extremely angry at myself and life. I feel like a huge failure. I feel like I failed at my relationship which was honestly the only thing I was living for. I lash out at people around me and at myself. 

I feel the world closing in on me and I can’t breath. I feel overwhelmed by the tasks I need to do in my life. I wish I could ask for anti anxiety meds but I can’t.

I can’t stop self sabotaging. I’ll spend a bunch of money or throw it away or stop working or just do erratic stupid stuff like drive fast and try to hit a wall at late at night when no one is around.

I’ve done traveling and spending time with friends and spending time with family and doing out and keeping busy but the second I stop distracting myself I lose my fucking mind. 

The only thing I loved or cared for was my ex and I don’t know what happened. One day everything was fine and the next she snapped and acted like I was the devil incarnate and treated me like I was her worst enemy. she does have potential mental issues so I don’t know.

The break up has exacerbated everything and made me a shell of myself",1,get dumped 6 month ago break wa extremely cruel brutal traumatic still feel like happened yesterday cry multiple time day top always suffered extreme depression suicide ex wa thing made even little happy partner left felt empty made serious attempt suicide several time tried antidepressant wa make irritable cognitively impaired point think enough job extremely severely depressed month quit trying even much work received several warning reason fired work culture manager easy going work home barely function barely sleep eat much everything erratic day okay walking get severe attachment anxiety go back car break tear disturbing thought fucked men eats inside want kill badly found good way feel stuck career life feel stuck want feel extremely angry life feel like huge failure feel like failed relationship wa honestly thing wa living lash people around feel world closing breath feel overwhelmed task need life wish could ask anti anxiety med stop self sabotaging spend bunch money throw away stop working erratic stupid stuff like drive fast try hit wall late night one around done traveling spending time friend spending time family keeping busy second stop distracting lose fucking mind thing loved cared wa ex know happened one day everything wa fine next snapped acted like wa devil incarnate treated like wa worst enemy doe potential mental issue know break ha exacerbated everything made shell,get dumped 6 month ago break wa extremely cruel brutal traumatic still feel like happened yesterday cry multiple time day top always suffered extreme depression suicide ex wa thing made even little happy partner left felt empty made serious attempt suicide several time tried antidepressant wa make irritable cognitively impaired point think enough job extremely severely depressed month quit trying even much work received several warning reason fired work culture manager easy going work home barely function barely sleep eat much everything erratic day okay walking get severe attachment anxiety go back car break tear disturbing thought fucked men eats inside want kill badly found good way feel stuck career life feel stuck want feel extremely angry life feel like huge failure feel like failed relationship wa honestly thing wa living lash people around feel world closing breath feel overwhelmed task need life wish could ask anti anxiety med stop self sabotaging spend bunch money throw away stop working erratic stupid stuff like drive fast try hit wall late night one around done traveling spending time friend spending time family keeping busy second stop distracting lose fucking mind thing loved cared wa ex know happened one day everything wa fine next snapped acted like wa devil incarnate treated like wa worst enemy doe potential mental issue know break ha exacerbated everything made shell
"I think I’m fairly high functioning when it comes to my depression. Luckily I can get out of bed and do basic tasks such a the dishes, laundry, or even taking out the trash without issues. My main issues are more about myself and the lack of others around me. I was a fairly social person as a child with a decent amount of friends but then as I grew older I started to realize I actually didn’t have friends. I started becoming more self drawn and didn’t hang out with people often anymore. I was comfortable being alone, I didn’t like many people. Unfortunately after so many years of solitude it’s become too much. I hate being alone because I hate me, and when I’m alone I’m all I have. As much as I don’t like myself at the same time I feel like I’m the only person I can truly talk to. When I try to talk to others I end up not saying what I want to say, yet I can recite my exact feelings to myself about anything and everything. Im the only person who truly understands me. Others think they have me figured out and what I’m about, but I think I live a double life. I put on this facade when around others cause I don’t feel comfortable being myself. If I can’t even like myself how could anyone else? I’m not good at making friends so it’s needles to say I don’t have any but despite such hatred for myself that’s who I talk to. I’m all I have, and it would seem I’m all I’ll ever have. Doomed alone with the one person I can honestly say I have hatred for in this world.

"It's strange that I've been on this site for a long time without ever posting or interacting. I actually posted my first time in another job-related subreddit, but deleted that post once it was clear I wasn't going to get a satisfactory reply. I think maybe years ago I made another post, but similarly deleted it too. It's been far too long to remember what it was even about. If I had to guess, it was to a place like this or an adjacent subreddit. Guess that's another fun depression symptom: instead of a brain with memories, I got one with a paper shredder.

Ah but what is memory worth anyway? In my case all it'd reveal is what I already know to be the truth, but in painful clarity. It is an odd feeling that comes over me whenever I try to recall things from the past. There are vast stretches of my mind and memory that have been wiped or buried in some sort of scorched earth campaign. The mental landscape feels just as torn, barren, and ominous. Depression might have robbed me of good memories in the purge, but going by my discomfort I can only imagine what might happen if the depths and lengths of my memory were recovered.

Fans of my previous TED talk here in r/depression will remember that this sad state of affairs goes back into childhood. Why? I don't know. I've tried everything I've been prescribed, took my pills, dieted, exercised, went to therapy, etc. etc. I'm quite tired of this song and dance, or going five rounds with people who can't get it through their head what my ""healing journey"" has been. I think with each passing year I'm more like a corpse than a man. Maybe I'm fated to be a lich; that'd make up for everything.

Not really though. I feel like I've gotten to a point where aliens could land on the White House lawn, and I'd barely care. It's not like it'd fix my pain, but it'd sure be intellectually stimulating I guess. Likewise an undead career spent tormenting the living doesn't actually sound appealing. Finding out ghosts are real or whatever other 'mindblowing' revelation isn't likely to move my needle, either. I'm still going to wake up the next day, and the day after, and the week, month, and year after, still all the same inside. The only real mindblow I can imagine is being happy in some real and lasting sense.

I suppose that is why from an early age I latched onto romantic love. Talk to anyone who has their alleged soulmate, and you'll not find somebody hating life. Funnily enough r/love was by far the worst subreddit I've ever visited, if only for my severe sour grapes reaction. I'm at the point where I don't believe anything close to that is even possible for me. For one, I'm too ""unique"", and even with friends I've always found it hard to relate. For another, I've spent so much of my life like this that this *is* me. There is no other me. Some people say they aren't their illness, but I literally cannot imagine who I'd even be without it. Believe me I'd chuck it in a heartbeat--if I could.

Anyway I stayed up way too late to write this crap. Hope you enjoyed my TED talk.",1,strange site long time without ever posting interacting actually posted first time another job related subreddit deleted post wa clear going get satisfactory reply think maybe year ago made another post similarly deleted far long remember wa even guess wa place like adjacent subreddit guess another fun depression symptom instead brain memory got one paper shredder ah memory worth anyway case reveal already know truth painful clarity odd feeling come whenever try recall thing past vast stretch mind memory wiped buried sort scorched earth campaign mental landscape feel torn barren ominous depression might robbed good memory purge going discomfort imagine might happen depth length memory recovered fan previous ted talk r depression remember sad state affair go back childhood know tried everything prescribed took pill dieted exercised went therapy etc etc quite tired song dance going five round people get head healing journey ha think passing year like corpse man maybe fated lich make everything really though feel like gotten point alien could land white house lawn barely care like fix pain sure intellectually stimulating guess likewise undead career spent tormenting living actually sound appealing finding ghost real whatever mindblowing revelation likely move needle either still going wake next day day week month year still inside real mindblow imagine happy real lasting sense suppose early age latched onto romantic love talk anyone ha alleged soulmate find somebody hating life funnily enough r love wa far worst subreddit ever visited severe sour grape reaction point believe anything close even possible one unique even friend always found hard relate another spent much life like people say illness literally cannot imagine even without believe chuck heartbeat could anyway stayed way late write crap hope enjoyed ted talk,strange site long time without ever posting interacting actually posted first time another job related subreddit deleted post wa clear going get satisfactory reply think maybe year ago made another post similarly deleted far long remember wa even guess wa place like adjacent subreddit guess another fun depression symptom instead brain memory got one paper shredder ah memory worth anyway case reveal already know truth painful clarity odd feeling come whenever try recall thing past vast stretch mind memory wiped buried sort scorched earth campaign mental landscape feel torn barren ominous depression might robbed good memory purge going discomfort imagine might happen depth length memory recovered fan previous ted talk r depression remember sad state affair go back childhood know tried everything prescribed took pill dieted exercised went therapy etc etc quite tired song dance going five round people get head healing journey ha think passing year like corpse man maybe fated lich make everything really though feel like gotten point alien could land white house lawn barely care like fix pain sure intellectually stimulating guess likewise undead career spent tormenting living actually sound appealing finding ghost real whatever mindblowing revelation likely move needle either still going wake next day day week month year still inside real mindblow imagine happy real lasting sense suppose early age latched onto romantic love talk anyone ha alleged soulmate find somebody hating life funnily enough r love wa far worst subreddit ever visited severe sour grape reaction point believe anything close even possible one unique even friend always found hard relate another spent much life like people say illness literally cannot imagine even without believe chuck heartbeat could anyway stayed way late write crap hope enjoyed ted talk

"I’m a 26 years old female and have always been depressed and anxious for most of my life. Now I know a big part of it is ADHD.

My depression is related to trauma from my teenage years. I went through psychological abuse from my caregivers. They were abusive and not aware of their behaviour. I’m doing better now.

My depression is also associated with… surprise, ADHD.

It’s oftentimes comorbid, meaning it can be a direct product of ADHD or be present at the same time. I’m not sure where mine is, probably a mix of both.

Untreated ADHD causes self-esteem issues. The person is often stuck feeling like a failure, a fraud, stuck in their potential not being able to accomplish more. The depression is often caused by not being able to manage the symptoms, the shame associated with them and the criticism often receive from an early age. This disorder is often viewed as character flaws because its symptoms are things that everyone deal with. It becomes a disorder when the person cannot manage this and the symptoms are always present.

It’s more than just inattention and hyperactivity. The hyperactivity can manifest as anxiety. Mine presents in racing thoughts (different from BP 2 and other disorders), insomnia that is caused by those racing thoughts, hyper fixations and also overthinking. My anxiety is also analysis paralysis and executive dysfunction. 

ADHDers experience what is called executive dysfunction, which is the phenomenon of not being able to execute something despite all the intention in the world. It’s often caused by overwhelm. 

The brain is literally different. The prefrontal cortex (the area behind the forehead) is smaller. The circuits of dopamine, amongst other neurotransmitters, don’t work properly. There aren’t enough. ADHDers are constantly chasing it with impulsive buying, blurting out things, varying interests, hyperfixations (intense interest in something and oftentimes not long) and hyperfocus (concentrating on a subject to the point of not being able to do something, often forgetting to eat, drink, pee and even sleep. It can also not be long). 

There’s also an emotional side of things. The ADHDer has intense emotions, sensitivity towards criticism and rejection and also easily prone to depression and anxiety. They’re also most likely to not be able to hold down jobs due to this.

There’s so much more to ADHD. This sub r/ADHD is full of information and people alike.

There’s a treatment. It doesn’t cure things but it helps to manage this disorder. It’s safe for most heathy individuals. 

Stimulants and non-stimulants.

Stimulants are methylphenidate (Concerta/Ritalin) and Amphetamines (Adderall and Vyvanse) there are a couple more of them, but I don’t know them all. Due to the lack of dopamine, taken at a therapeutic dosage, this calms the ADHD mind and allows better management of the symptoms. Oftentimes the anxiety and depression are gone. 

The non-stimulants are Strattera and Wellbutrin. There are a couple more of them out there. They act on neuro adrenaline, another neurotransmitter responsible for ADHD. They are often used as a last resort after stimulants don’t work or in combination with them.

Therapy is offered along with medication to learn coping strategies and to heal trauma associated with years of being undiagnosed.

Take that appointment with a competent ADHD doctor or psychiatrist and don’t be afraid to seek the help you deserve.

So we marry again and that fails too

"I find it funny how most people in this world can care less for people with depression until they say their ready to kill themselves. I may sound like a bitxh but telling someone last minute before they kill them selves “it’s not worth it”, “life gets better”, “you’re loved and worth it” etc, is just bs. I’m not saying to let them do it, it just sucks how much people wanna show you they “love and care” about you until you’re ready to leave. Why does it take so much for the ones we want to love or simply love to just see how much pain we are in. To see that if we had a sliver of hope or happiness we would want to stay.

I used to think I was beautiful, and I’m not trying to sound full of myself but I did think I was pretty. My family had told me that and my mothers coworkers, so that’s what I assumed.

"I have seasonal depression, panic disorder, and GAD and these are some of the things I do to help my seasonal depression and anxiety, they may not work for you, but I hope it helps someone out there. It can be hard to do them all, but I always try to do at least 2. Whatever works for you.

(Also you might see this around a couple subs, but I want to spread this as much as possible in the hopes it helps someone.)

1. Keep your curtains open, even if it's gloomy outside, natural light is still better than artificial light or no light at all. The lack of vitamin D in fall and winter months is the main cause of seasonal depression so getting as much as you can is important. You can consider getting vitamin D supplements or even a light therapy lamp if you have the money.
2. Keep in contact with people, talk to your family, friends, bf/gf, whoever. We often want to isolate ourselves but that is one of the worst things we can do. You don't have to talk to them about all your problems if you're not comfortable, but just having someone's company can help, even if it's online.
3. Create. I like to keep myself busy by being creative. I'm in graphic design so I like making posters, websites, packaging, etc., Other things can be painting, drawing, knitting, making music, literally anything. The act of creating something gives purpose, to me at least. And can remain pretty cheap depending.
4. Try to eat as well as possible. You don't have to go on a whole diet and cut out all junk food, or sugar, or whatever. But, I tend to get into the habit of eating a lot of junk food, which in turn makes me want to lay in bed and sleep even more, which obviously doesn't help. Maybe don't buy as much fast food, limit it to once or twice a week. Cook a homemade meal at least once a week. Even if you're not good at cooking, learning isn't hard especially with the vast amount of recipes on the internet, plus it gives you something to do and you get to create something! At the very least, try to get the nutrients you need, vitamin D!, protein, calcium, all of that, is important and can make a difference.
5. If you don't like being creative, learn something! Download Duolingo and learn a language, research any topics you're interested in, maybe keep a notebook of all the stuff you learn, learn a new skill, learn an instrument, take a free online class (or paid if you have the money) again, anything.
6. Try to keep at least semi-active, you don't have to be doing full workouts 3 times a week. Even cleaning can be exercise. Even if it's cold out, bundle up and go for a walk, sometimes the cold air can be a bit of a refresher and snow can be pretty (if it snows where you live LOL). Yoga and just general stretching can help if you're laying in bed or sitting at a computer all day.
7. That brings me to my next one. Keep your area clean. Whether it's your bedroom or apartment, house, whatever. You don't have to do some deep spring cleaning or anything, but just training yourself to clean up dishes right after you use them, putting your laundry away right away, putting things right into the garbage, keep your floors vacuumed, don't hoard dishes or drinks in your room, putting things back where they belong, etc. Even if you can do only one of these things, that's enough.
8. Next point, I can't remember where I read it but someone said ""try to do one productive thing every day"". It can literally be the smallest thing, like taking some dishes downstairs and putting them in the dishwasher/washing them, or taking a shower. I noticed sometimes when I do one productive thing, it's easier for me to get into doing more. It can be hard to just get up sometimes but literally the smallest things can make a difference.
9. Keep up with personal hygiene. You don't have to be getting all dressed up, putting makeup on, whatever all the time. But, even a simple skin care routine can help, I love cleanser, scrub, and moisturizer. Taking care of your hair, eating decent, exercising a bit here and there when you can. Even showering cause even that can be hard sometimes. I personally love painting my own nails and literally have not had bare nails once in 7 years and it makes me feel a lot better (plus it keeps me from biting my nails! LOL)
10. As cliché as it sounds, drink water. You may not even notice a difference but it is very important and we can often forget about it when we're in a slump.
11. Be sure to regularly take any medications your are currently prescribed (if any) and talk to your doctor if they're not working, you don't feel right, or any other reason.
12. Work and/or school. Whether you're in high school, college, working part-time, working full time, not working, whatever it may be. But, try your best in them, again it can be hard because of the depression which I get. But, ask for help when you need it, keep yourself organized, don't let assignments and tasks build up, study for tests as best you can, keep a schedule, communicate with your teachers, coworkers, managers, whoever it may be.
13. Good sleep schedule. This one I don't personally follow, because my sleep schedule is absolutely fucked right now, but it's on my list. But, not only do you get proper energy, but it's been proven to help you mentally as well, and is one more step to a good schedule.
14. If you're really not doing so well, consider therapy and/or maybe medication. I understand money and availability can be an issue, but there are also resources online, or maybe through your school/work.

Overall, getting as much light as possible, personal hygiene, communicating with other people, and keeping busy are the most important things to me. Whatever works for you, just take it one day at a time and do what you can. Every little bit helps. I hope this helps even a little bit! I wish the best for the everyone!

"This might be incredibly weird, but I feel like a huge factor of fuel for my depressive episodes are from looking back at the past. You know, some people say ""look back at all those good memories"", and it's true! 

But whenever I do, I end up crying, feeling incredibly dreadful, alone, and just empty? Like, I'm reminding myself of days of joy, genuinely good times, and old friends, but those are all gone. It's hard for me to enjoy those memories, especially since they almost all come from events that are completely over. From things as simple and dumb as video games to even just certain YouTube videos and people I watched when I was younger. Life lately has felt so bland, receptive, and empty. 

It's hard to find joy these days, with people I meet to the hobbies I have ( with one exception ), or new hobbies I try to find, it all just feels tasteless.

So.. My roommate and I have been living together for about 9 years now.. We dated for 8 of those years. Broke up while the love was still there because we realized we would only hurt each other until we resent each other. Her mother came to town to visit her mother so now she's staying with them at the grandmother's place. Very few times have I been alone. Actually think this is the first time alone in the house for more than 2 days.. Last time we were apart was when she went to one town and I went to my hometown. So I wasn't alone. Anyways. I went from living with my parents. To my grans in a small town where I couldn't find work up until I started dating my current roommate. Then we moved in together. Bottom line... I've never been alone. So first couple days I thought sure I'll be good. But now.. Not so much. It started with a little loneliness. Emotions hit hard. Been struggling with sleep. Like a lot. Haven't kept up with hygeine... And now... I've hit the numb feeling. I felt some raw emotions when the mask came off. And now. I guess my defense mechanisms recognized that I can't even take the mask off when I'm alone either. So to avoid the raw emotions my mind wouldn't let me take the mask off after getting home from work and I'm here awake again. Needing sleep before I go back to work. I feel nothing. But I know deep down. There's a storm raging. And I have detached to avoid it.... I fear one day. That my traumas I thought i worked on and all my masking will catch up... And my life will just.... End... I'm tired. In every way possible... My soul could use some rest. Being alone is... Idk. I just don't know...,1,roommate living together 9 year dated 8 year broke love wa still realized would hurt resent mother came town visit mother staying grandmother place time alone actually think first time alone house 2 day last time apart wa went one town went hometown alone anyways went living parent gran small town find work started dating current roommate moved together bottom line never alone first couple day thought sure good much started little loneliness emotion hit hard struggling sleep like lot kept hygeine hit numb feeling felt raw emotion mask came guess defense mechanism recognized even take mask alone either avoid raw emotion mind let take mask getting home work awake needing sleep go back work feel nothing know deep storm raging detached avoid fear one day trauma thought worked masking catch life end tired every way possible soul could use rest alone idk know,roommate living together 9 year dated 8 year broke love wa still realized would hurt resent mother came town visit mother staying grandmother place time alone actually think first time alone house 2 day last time apart wa went one town went hometown alone anyways went living parent gran small town find work started dating current roommate moved together bottom line never alone first couple day thought sure good much started little loneliness emotion hit hard struggling sleep like lot kept hygeine hit numb feeling felt raw emotion mask came guess defense mechanism recognized even take mask alone either avoid raw emotion mind let take mask getting home work awake needing sleep go back work feel nothing know deep storm raging detached avoid fear one day trauma thought worked masking catch life end tired every way possible soul could use rest alone idk know

"I am truly alone now, every bridge I had was burned either by me or the other party. I have lost all of my friends either because they didn't want to hang out out me anymore because I made them uncomfortable or because we grew apart because I don't do anything social anymore. However I still didn't consider myself fully alone until the situation with my parents.   They were the straw that broke the camel's back.


 They were always condescending pricks when it came to my depression. The day I attempted suicide (and it only failed because of a dumbass oversight of mine) they became alot more empathetic and caring. I thought they had finally learned and realized how they were acting. At least that was the case until very recentely. They were acting very kind and understanding after my attempt and as the days went on they slowly morphed back to the people they used to be.

That's when I realized that they will never fucking change. If a fucking suicide attempt won't change them nothing fucking will. Now I don't talk to them at all. All I do is go to work and work the night shift and come home and lock myself in my room and rot away in my room. The 2 fucking people I thought would care are the ones that have been the worst for my health. Fuck them i hope they rot in hell.

Lately I've been going through a severe depressive episode where almost anything can tick me off and I get into such a horrible mindset to the point of tears. I try to change things but it's so hard and I can't see myself to even succeed in life at all. I've hit such a low point in my 22 years of living where even my parents and friends are becoming sick and tired of me. What's the point of even being alive anymore? I try so hard with everything but I always fall short and never get anything. I'm such a massive disappointment and I wouldn't mind if something tragic happened to me.

"I’ve (M, 21)been dating my girlfriend (22) for about 2 and a half years now. An entire year of that time has been spent by me being severely depressed. Every time I try to talk about my mental state she just tells me I need to change my mindset and that I’m allowing myself to stay this way. I’m not. Every day is a struggle to even know where the fuck I’m at. Every day is a struggle due to the tremors and racing heart and extra anxiety. All of that on top of being a computer science major which is incredibly difficult for me to handle. It’s just impossible to explain to her that I literally am not in control of half of my thoughts. I don’t know what is, but it’s not me. It’s so hard to make it through a single day without feeling like I’d be better off not existing. She takes that as me saying I don’t enjoy her company when really all I want is for her to just sit down and listen to me without trying to give any solutions. I just need someone to listen to me and understand how hard this shit really is. It’s so hard to look forward to the next day because I know tomorrow is just going to be more homework or going to my part time shitty job that I hardly get paid for. I just want to make it out of college but she thinks I’m making myself sad for some reason. That just makes me feel worse, am I keeping myself like this? I don’t think I am but I’m not sure now that she keeps telling me to simply “change my mindset”.  It’s torture explaining to her why I’m not happy.

This one is my** father's**, and there was more said than that one word**, **but** it's **the one that stuck; it’s the one that** stained **me and seared itself into my brain.** It's **the word I can always hear**, **and its the word that somehow cuts to my soul. This word was told to me while I was suicidal when I honestly just had the goal to make it to the next day and then repeat. When my partner and my friends were literally babysitting me and watching me.**  **It happened after being fired from my job, having multiple negative** interactions **with my emotionally abusive family after YEARS of guilt shaming and dismissal of me, after asking a relative to take the child (not my own) under my care because my suicide plan was to crash my car and I was her transporter and also because I WAS GETTING WORSE. This was under 2 years after burying my sister and my dog since I was 12y/o 3 days apart and dealt with my mother having a risky surgery and that was all within 5 days of one another , dealing with the pandemic and honestly a shit ton of things that just piled on as extra with the larger things.** 

**This happened because I was unable to care for a child that was not mine and whose loss I mourned like she was my actual fucking kid (which did not help the SI). My father now wanting to pretend to be a good human being decided that although he basically threw away this kid, her brother and her mother when they needed help and cause the events that lead to me having her; was shamed of me for letting her go. And just so that no one comes for me, it took me weeks to decide to let her go because i wasn’t getting better and worked to keep it together to give her a smooth transition and assure her that she didn’t do a damn thing. I did the best I could and still i felt/feel shamed for not being able to keep her without my dads words.** 

**I’m not sure where I am even going with this,** **​But ​PLEASE if you have kids don’t say some shit like this to them. It’s cruel, you can’t take it back, and it will leave a scar that won’t heal easily. Maybe it will get better with more time but its been months and here I sit randomly on a friday night happily dancing and singing to be suddenly struck down by a single word. And I hate that I know if I do get the point where I attempt that word will be one of the last things I leave this world with, and that is the cruelest joke of all.**

"I was born in an abusive family and have been abused for many years by my psychopathic mother just before I had to go to the children's home. I'm a school dropout, have been homeless and struggle with autism and PTSD. I hardly know how to function in life but I managed anyway to start my own cyber security company and earn a good amount of money, just to never cash it out and get ripped off by my co-founder who tricked me with a straw man contract, ripped all the money and left me 120k in debt and homeless again. Now after a lot of struggle I live in a completely empty flat (just a cooking plate on the ground), can barely afford food for me and my cat and own absolutely nothing, just a computer. I can't even pay my medical bills and several doctors started a court on me because I was doing surgery anyways without paying afterwards, doing some kind of doctor-hopping while spitting blood everyday and  watching my body getting destroyed from my autoimmune disorder. And this is only the tip of the iceberg, if I would start explaining my situation, I would't even know where to start because I lost sight in all of this bullshit. Now my life is even more fucked, I tackle these problems one by one but I seem to drown in them. I have been fighting to survive this fucked up life for almost 30 years now and I'm fucking done with it. My whole life was a struggle, nothing beautiful, only fucked up ghetto shit and horror shit since childhood. It's just fucking ridiculous. It's hard for me to even find words anymore. Fuck this world. I don't even know if suicide even works to get out of here. Im so fucking done with this shit. Fuck this. Fuck all of this. I just wanna scream my soul out of my fucking body.

"I can't sleep. I can't stop thinking about how everyone else seems to have life figured out. My two friends I moved to college with are getting into relationships while I'm sitting by myself in my room doomed to be alone forever. It's not that I don't want to put myself out there and try new things, it's that the very thought of that makes me feel sick because it's so far outside my comfort zone. I've always wanted to ""do"" something, like something that makes me feel validated. Why do I feel like I need validation from others? Can I not feel valid on my own? I don't know how to explain this horrible feeling I feel when I see someone else who is talented at something that I want so badly to be talented at as well. I admire them so much that I hate them. I hate that I can't be them. I want to be a talented artist so badly. Not even as a job, just as a hobby. I bought an expensive iPad to draw on and for what? To waste my life away watching YouTube on? I never touch the drawing app I bought for it. I love art. Art can be anything the creator desires it to be. Problem is, I don't have an ounce of creativity in my bones. I'm like a black hole for creativity: I enjoy other peoples' art but any creativity I take in will never find its way out again. I guess that's what makes me such a good programmer, not that-that matters I can't have any original programming ideas. I just lifelessly drone what my professor wants me to program into Eclipse and get a good grade on it. Is that all I'm good for? Programming to fuel someone else's creativity? I'm a hardcore introvert, but I secretly want some attention. I want people to see what I've created. For once, I want to be the one receiving nice comments for my awesome artwork instead of the one giving those comments but, reality check, I'm too depressed to even reach across my room to grab my iPad, let alone actually create art on it. My friends tell me I'm good at art. Honestly, some of the stuff I've drawn looks pretty sick, but the only stuff I've drawn have been me copying someone else's drawing (copying, not tracing). I'm incapable of creating anything original. It's not that I don't know any drawing techniques, I've passed an art class mind you, it's that my void of a creative soul cannot come up with an original idea to save my life. Trying to draw figures makes me want to shoot myself, I'd much rather observe someone else's art and blatantly ripoff their figure's pose. I'm so sick of feeling inferior. I want to feel like I'm worth something. If I could just fucking make myself practice drawing, or anything for that matter, I could actually live up to the people I want so badly to be. But instead here I am, skulking on Reddit about how I'm barely a functional human being. I could just die, and the world would move on without skipping a beat. I don't matter. I'm just a broke, depressed college student who is more of a burden to society than a member. If I can't motivate myself to do something I actually want to accomplish, then how in the living hell am I supposed to find the motivation to finish school and get a job? Can I spend the rest of my life playing video games? Probably not, but I can try, and if it doesn't go well? Well, killing myself is always an option, which I find some sort of weird, sick comfort in. That is all. It is now 4:11 AM and I am going to sleep. I'm not going to proofread this, and I'm not going to format it into fancy little paragraphs. Why? Because at the end of the day, it simply does not matter.

"I don't know that this is the right sub because it verges on relationship advice but:

All  the background you need is that I've been separated from my wife for  over a year. We have one daughter. No infidelity. We amicably decided we  would separate because things weren't great between the two of us. I  helped her move and we've been good friends since and regularly see each  other.

Cut to one week ago, I  found out I was leaving for 6 months for work which is followed by my  wife telling me she is dating someone else. I'm heartbroken. Then she  says its serious enough that she wants to introduce my daughter to him  while I'm gone. We have a long talk and realize I've been thinking this  separation was something it wasn't. We file divorce papers before I  leave. I've lost my best friend.

We're going to do something this  weekend for my daughter for an hour or two but I want nothing more than  to spend the weekend with the two of them and I realize she wants to be  somewhere else and with someone else and I can't stand it.

I’ve been depressed for so long now I don’t even remember a time in the past few weeks ( maybe months) where I was generally happy. Last week I wrote my suicide note on my phone. This week I cried in the bathroom at work and just ended up leaving. Was supposed to have a date this week but everything just falls apart. It’ll be weirder if it didn’t.how can I entertain someone when the only thing going through my mind is dark shit. I thought I was getting better today. I took a shower and didn’t cry in it. Put the trash out. Even did a little calisthenics training. Fxcking phones. You flip through and find one picture you didn’t delete and now you’re back to square one. I hate this feeling and I hate that it’s getting so familiar that it’s starting to feel normal. I just want to be happy. That’s it. No heavy chest pain. No gut wrenching depression. No alcohol headaches. I just wanna smile and mean it. Laugh and mean it. But I guess that’s not how the universe works. Someone has to lose so others can be happy. Fxcking balance of the universe.

"I lost my job in July. It was my fault, my responsibility. I accept that. For various legal reasons, I cannot get unemployment and I haven't been able to get another job since even though I've sent dozens of applications.

I don't want to suffer anymore. I don't want my life to get worse than it is but I don't see a way out. I gave up. I know it. I just want to lay down and pass away.

Then it went downhill. We went out to a bar to meet up with other people and I had nobody to talk to, I started talking to two guys, but they were so disinterested and bored I wanted to disappear. I cried because of it, but later I got over it and thought that at least I showed up and talked, so I was proud of myself and gave myself a pat on the back. It didn't work out the first time, whatever.  


Then people from the dorm organized a meeting to get to know each other and the same thing happened all over again. My roommate was doing great and talking with everybody, made friends and I was invisible. I don't know why I'm so boring and people don't want anything to do with me...

Idk I just needed to vent, because at the beginning I was full of hope and ready for a new start. Years in isolation made me believe that I'm interesting, but my problem was that I wasn't putting myself out there. But now that I tried to meet people I see that I'm just unlikable.

Man I’ve been suffering recently but today pushed me to the edge. I was using regaine which is extremely poisonous even in small doses for cats but it doesn’t mention it anywhere on the packaging so I had no idea. Afterwards I was playing with their kitten and it probably got on her fur and the she licked it off. A little while later I noticed she was acting a bit weird and looked pretty lethargic so I googled it and found out about it’s toxicity and took her to the vet.

"Seeing her with someone else pains me so. It worsens my suicidal thoughts and puts me in such a lower position. I feel so worthless knowing the one person who you were with but fucked up with is now being treated better by someone that isn’t you.

I don’t feel okay. I haven’t been since she broke up with me in August of 2019. I want to talk to her about how I feel but at the same I don’t want to because of course she’s with someone else and it’d be inappropriate to just bring all of my burdens upon her. But I just feel she’d be the only person I’d be able to open up about my feelings, which is ironic because the lack of being able to express my feelings toward her was one of the reason why our relationship went downhill and why I was such a toxic and manipulative person.

Now that I’ve traced back my steps and re-evaluated myself I’ve fixed everything regarding my toxicity. The remains that stay are the aftermath. The effect of being alone and having nobody. The feeling of losing the one soulmate because of your recklessness

It’s like, you’re such a monster that your greed, your selfishness begins to blind you of what’s important. And once you finally break through, it’s all too late. You fix your flaws. Your negatives. Your abusiveness, toxicity, manipulation and gaslighting demeanour. But now what remains are the scars from a traumatic event. The depression, the suicidal tendencies, the sadness and anxiety that came as a result of your flaws. If it’s not one thing it’s another man. It sucks.",1,seeing someone else pain worsens suicidal thought put lower position feel worthless knowing one person fucked treated better someone feel okay since broke august 2019 want talk feel want course someone else inappropriate bring burden upon feel person able open feeling ironic lack able express feeling toward wa one reason relationship went downhill wa toxic manipulative person traced back step evaluated fixed everything regarding toxicity remains stay aftermath effect alone nobody feeling losing one soulmate recklessness like monster greed selfishness begin blind important finally break late fix flaw negative abusiveness toxicity manipulation gaslighting demeanour remains scar traumatic event depression suicidal tendency sadness anxiety came result flaw one thing another man suck,seeing someone else pain worsens suicidal thought put lower position feel worthless knowing one person fucked treated better someone feel okay since broke august 2019 want talk feel want course someone else inappropriate bring burden upon feel person able open feeling ironic lack able express feeling toward wa one reason relationship went downhill wa toxic manipulative person traced back step evaluated fixed everything regarding toxicity remains stay aftermath effect alone nobody feeling losing one soulmate recklessness like monster greed selfishness begin blind important finally break late fix flaw negative abusiveness toxicity manipulation gaslighting demeanour remains scar traumatic event depression suicidal tendency sadness anxiety came result flaw one thing another man suck

"My boyfriend is depressed, but due to his current situation, he can’t go to therapy. We are in a long distance relationship and college students. He’s not suicidal, but has admitted to being insecure and jealous. Sometimes he lashes out at me angrily and accuses me of things, but I know he doesn’t mean it. He always tries to leave conversations because he says he is a burden, but that just makes me so sad because I love him and he isn’t a burden to me. Sometimes it is hard to get through to him though because he refuses to talk to me, so I can’t even begin to figure out what is wrong in that moment.

I used to be depressed, so I have tried doing things I wished people would’ve done for me. This hasn’t worked very much, and I’m trying not to beat myself up for failing him. I’ve caught myself being depressed again, and I want to stay strong and make sure I am here for my boyfriend.

"I just want to feel wanted, or loved, or just anything. I'm only 26, and I'm tired. I've lived my life, and i was asked recently what is one thing you want to do before you die and the first answer that came to mine was just that. to die. I've accepted the idea of death already and i don't fear it. I've attempted in the past numerous times and unfortunately I'm here, and don't get me wrong i can function, and go socialize. but i sit daily finding myself just waiting. doing nothing, feeling nothing. just waiting. But one thing i realized i do want, is to see what it feels like to be loved. Unconditionally. i never got it from my mother, or family. and the people who could've shown me died before me. any woman i attempt to get close with, romantically or not. just see's me as annoying, and any friends i try to make either want to use me for sex, or skills i provide. but i'm so in want of feeling loved i do what they ask most of the time. i just want this to end. i don't think i'll make it past the day my last animal dies. so i have what i assume is about 10 years left. and i'd just like to feel loved with someone to wake up to, to talk with about this and understands. to show me that hey, the 21 years since your first traumatic incident and the pain and suffering that i endured was worth the wait for something this great. but what do i know. other than sadness and depression. pain and loss. i don't even want to live with myself why would anyone else..   
don't give me that false positivity everyone gives.

"I guess it has been a long time coming. Putting on an act as the ""jokester"" at work all the while drinking myself to sleep the second I got home. If and when I open up about my depression I am usually met with ridicule or indifference because people generally could not see me as mentally ill. It is like feeling alone at a party even though I am surrounded by friends who enjoy having me there.

Maybe no one here can relate to this. Maybe I am  just needlessly wallowing in my self-pity for attention. Maybe I am just an ungrateful piece of....doodoo. I don't know.

However, what I DO know is that when I am drunk none of that bothered me. So naturally, faced with a choice between self hatred and alcohol-induced comfort, I gravitated towards the latter. But today I ran out of alcohol and thought to myself: ""I guess I will just not drink on a Wednesday afternoon....you know, like a normal person"" but boy was I in for a big shock. My hands were shaking, I broke my PR for anxiety, and I descended into a downward spiral of negative thoughts, inevitably reaching rock bottom which is me telling myself ""whats the point? Die...."" Mind you, I am no stranger to any of the aforementioned idealizations, but what shocked me was my mind turned to alcohol as if it  was the solution(seriously, no pun intended but there is one here...). 

Now I am drunk again after a quick trip to the store. Ironically being drunk has straightened my mind and the fact that I might be an alcoholic just dawned on me. Honestly, I don't know what to make of this new self discovery...maybe because I am a bottle-half-empty kind of guy. But as of now, I feel only drinking can make me less miserable. That is a problem, but I will worry about that if and when I sober up....

I dont know why I am posting this. I guess I just want to vent and I don't expect anyone to care because no one ever had. But if you made it this far I implore you: if you can help it, please don't drink to cope with depression",1,guess ha long time coming putting act jokester work drinking sleep second got home open depression usually met ridicule indifference people generally could see mentally ill like feeling alone party even though surrounded friend enjoy maybe one relate maybe needlessly wallowing self pity attention maybe ungrateful piece doodoo know however know drunk none bothered naturally faced choice self hatred alcohol induced comfort gravitated towards latter today ran alcohol thought guess drink wednesday afternoon know like normal person boy wa big shock hand shaking broke pr anxiety descended downward spiral negative thought inevitably reaching rock bottom telling whats point die mind stranger aforementioned idealization shocked wa mind turned alcohol wa solution seriously pun intended one drunk quick trip store ironically drunk ha straightened mind fact might alcoholic dawned honestly know make new self discovery maybe bottle half empty kind guy feel drinking make le miserable problem worry sober dont know posting guess want vent expect anyone care one ever made far implore help please drink cope depression,guess ha long time coming putting act jokester work drinking sleep second got home open depression usually met ridicule indifference people generally could see mentally ill like feeling alone party even though surrounded friend enjoy maybe one relate maybe needlessly wallowing self pity attention maybe ungrateful piece doodoo know however know drunk none bothered naturally faced choice self hatred alcohol induced comfort gravitated towards latter today ran alcohol thought guess drink wednesday afternoon know like normal person boy wa big shock hand shaking broke pr anxiety descended downward spiral negative thought inevitably reaching rock bottom telling whats point die mind stranger aforementioned idealization shocked wa mind turned alcohol wa solution seriously pun intended one drunk quick trip store ironically drunk ha straightened mind fact might alcoholic dawned honestly know make new self discovery maybe bottle half empty kind guy feel drinking make le miserable problem worry sober dont know posting guess want vent expect anyone care one ever made far implore help please drink cope depression

"Pretty much just that. I feel very unheard, I feel like my friends ignore me or interrupt me most of the time and don't really value my thoughts or opinions. I feel frustrated because I have trouble articulating sometimes. I'm thinking about how all the people in my life who claimed to like me so much never invite me to hang out or actually want to see me - like my old work friends who still all have big parties... with almost everyone but me. I can't stop wondering what I'm doing wrong. Am I annoying? Uninteresting? I try to be a positive person without being over the top. I just feel so alone. The only friends I hang out with I also live with and I can't help but feel like I'd never be invited around if I didn't live here - I mean they never really listen to me or involve me in much so I get really worried that I'm like an intruder here.

I'm taking this semester off school but I've been so bad I don't think I can even do it next semester either, but I also can't afford to have to start paying back loans. Money is so tight and my insurance is such trash that I can't remotely afford a therapist and I'm medicating on hoarded antipsychotics (I knew my insurance would go kaput so I stocked up on all my refills). I'm teetering on the edge of functionality. I recently moved and I literally couldn't have done it without my gf. Like I just couldn't have. Next month my friend has a wedding I said I'd go to but I haven't bought tickets yet nor do I know if I can get myself to even go but I also dread telling her I'd miss her wedding. I lied about being sick to avoid my gfs party, and immediately regretted it because I wanted to go - I just couldn't bring myself to finish my very very easy costume.

I dont know what to do. I feel so lonely and annoying and hated. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or why I don't have friends. I'm so disappointed on myself for fucking up college for a second time. I spill my feelings then apologize for burdening people then feel guilty because I'm terrified that I'm manipulating them by opening up. I'm just so lost and I need any encouragement that it'll be okay.",1,pretty much feel unheard feel like friend ignore interrupt time really value thought opinion feel frustrated trouble articulating sometimes thinking people life claimed like much never invite hang actually want see like old work friend still big party almost everyone stop wondering wrong annoying uninteresting try positive person without top feel alone friend hang also live help feel like never invited around live mean never really listen involve much get really worried like intruder taking semester school bad think even next semester either also afford start paying back loan money tight insurance trash remotely afford therapist medicating hoarded antipsychotic knew insurance would go kaput stocked refill teetering edge functionality recently moved literally done without gf like next month friend ha wedding said go bought ticket yet know get even go also dread telling miss wedding lied sick avoid gfs party immediately regretted wanted go bring finish easy costume dont know feel lonely annoying hated know wrong friend disappointed fucking college second time spill feeling apologize burdening people feel guilty terrified manipulating opening lost need encouragement okay,pretty much feel unheard feel like friend ignore interrupt time really value thought opinion feel frustrated trouble articulating sometimes thinking people life claimed like much never invite hang actually want see like old work friend still big party almost everyone stop wondering wrong annoying uninteresting try positive person without top feel alone friend hang also live help feel like never invited around live mean never really listen involve much get really worried like intruder taking semester school bad think even next semester either also afford start paying back loan money tight insurance trash remotely afford therapist medicating hoarded antipsychotic knew insurance would go kaput stocked refill teetering edge functionality recently moved literally done without gf like next month friend ha wedding said go bought ticket yet know get even go also dread telling miss wedding lied sick avoid gfs party immediately regretted wanted go bring finish easy costume dont know feel lonely annoying hated know wrong friend disappointed fucking college second time spill feeling apologize burdening people feel guilty terrified manipulating opening lost need encouragement okay
"It’s been 3 years since everyday’s the same. I wake up, go to school, play games and sleep. In the day, I enjoy life but there are some very lonely nights in my life. 3 years ago, I had a really great friend and had a crush on her, but we changed school before I could tell her. Some nights, I think about her even though I know I won’t see her again. I don’t fake to be happy in the day, I really am. The only problem is that from times to times (1-5 days in the month) some nights are very hard and I realize that my life is just the same. Recently, one of my really good friend went to a different country. Now I’m stuck in some kind of endless school loop. Time passes quite fast but each time I get just a little better, I get one of those hard nights...

It’s been 3 years. I’m dying inside but just like I said, I’m only sad in some nights of the month but when I’m sad, it’s almost like I was continuing my previous sad night.

"I hate feeling this way, I really do, but the existing proof is more in favor of people being happier without me here.

I feel like I'm just broken beyond repair, I've never really impacted anyone positively in my life. In fact, I've done the opposite a few times because of how unstable I am. I have no motivation and can hardly leave my room most days. I feel like the world has given up on me and no one wants to help me, to believe in me, and I don't believe in myself. The mental health treatment I get here doesn't help and I can't afford private care. I just exist, that's it, and to be honest, I don't want to do anything either. I just want to hide away. I hate that this is all my mind cycles through, all the time. I hate this feeling.

"I’ve had major depressive disorder since I was a kid. It getting dark early always made me sad, and just being in cloudy bleak cold darkness all the time made my depression even worse every fall and winter. 
 
Later on, I experienced ongoing traumas, and more seemed to keep happening when fall/winter would roll around. So my PTSD is always triggered the second I start noticing days getting shorter and I need to pull my coat out from my winter clothes, temps hit 50s and the last of the heat spikes are over.

I feel like I’m in those horrible times again even though I know I’m not. It just feels like in my body that I’m in it again. I know this is a depression group, but the important thing is this phenomenon every year leads to deeper depression for me.

So I was wondering if any of you who experience seasonal sadness have anything that helps you both when the time approaches, and getting all the way through the worst of the winter.

"I want to preface this by saying that this may be a heavy post for some  people. I think people in general want to feel loved and wanted by others. To those who are reading this, you are loved.  

I am looking forward to working out so that I can enter a certain  occupation. I feel like going to a university would be good for me because it would help me not be so afraid of change. I may have to go  back on antidepressants before I go into academia; however, this isn't something I am going to give up on so easily, with or without  medication. I still feel intense moments of loneliness and I get that uncomfortable warmth in my chest that I cannot shake. It comes in waves  and it can be triggered by going back to places where I felt my lowest. Going back to my old job of working at a fast food place would make me feel horrible, so I'm not going back to anything like that. I want to help people and I want to change my environment quickly enough so that I can witness that change unfold among my very own eyes.  

I tried to kill myself near the beginning of December and I didn't get the chance to fully heal from that; it's  been difficult for me to trust a therapist. I am going to see a therapist this Sunday, though. I can think of a few example questions to  ask you, the post viewer, to try to answer, but I think that this  post's title is the true question. If you have any questions for me,  feel free to ask.

"Last fall was the shittiest fall I’ve ever been through, I left an abusive relationship, lots of other stuff I don’t want to get into, and then of course to end it off, not a month after getting out of a terrible relationship, my dog has to leave. I don’t want to get into specifics, but basically someone close to me took my dog against my will and tomorrow is the one year anniversary. This sucks. This fucking sucks. I’m not supposed to be this damn emotional over a dog that left a year ago who probably didn’t even love me back the same way yet here I am. One year ago today, this exact time, I have a selfie of me kissing her while she licks me back, and we’ve both got huge smiles. 

I’m already struggling to feel anything positive with other stuff going on and now this realization that I’ve been trying to avoid hits me like a damn train. It’s been a year without my best friend.

She’s not even my dog anymore why do I keep calling her my dog. She’s not my dog. But she is. She’s not though. She’s probably forgotten about me. 

I can’t do this",1,last fall wa shittiest fall ever left abusive relationship lot stuff want get course end month getting terrible relationship dog ha leave want get specific basically someone close took dog tomorrow one year anniversary suck fucking suck supposed damn emotional dog left year ago probably even love back way yet one year ago today exact time selfie kissing lick back got huge smile already struggling feel anything positive stuff going realization trying avoid hit like damn train year without best friend even dog anymore keep calling dog dog though probably forgotten,last fall wa shittiest fall ever left abusive relationship lot stuff want get course end month getting terrible relationship dog ha leave want get specific basically someone close took dog tomorrow one year anniversary suck fucking suck supposed damn emotional dog left year ago probably even love back way yet one year ago today exact time selfie kissing lick back got huge smile already struggling feel anything positive stuff going realization trying avoid hit like damn train year without best friend even dog anymore keep calling dog dog though probably forgotten
"I recommend you to stop your current life routine, book a flight, go to some far countries or poor countries to teach people English, yes, to be a teacher for at least 1 year. It gives you time to rethink about life, and students usually make teacher feel fulfilled and useful, that's extremely helpful to your depression. When you stuck don't think about death immediately, try to jump to a new life, new society, nothing to lose. You just need time to be aware of a lot of things. What I'm saying here is, even English is one of your abilities that so many people are craving for have, offer them help, make yourself useful, devote yourself to children or some innocent community, they'll give you all the cures back.",1,recommend stop current life routine book flight go far country poor country teach people english yes teacher least 1 year give time rethink life student usually make teacher feel fulfilled useful extremely helpful depression stuck think death immediately try jump new life new society nothing lose need time aware lot thing saying even english one ability many people craving offer help make useful devote child innocent community give cure back,recommend stop current life routine book flight go far country poor country teach people english yes teacher least 1 year give time rethink life student usually make teacher feel fulfilled useful extremely helpful depression stuck think death immediately try jump new life new society nothing lose need time aware lot thing saying even english one ability many people craving offer help make useful devote child innocent community give cure back
"jesus fucking christ i dont have the energy to type this shit. dont even know where to start! all i know is i see people living out their lives perfectly just the way i wish i could, all these people doing shit that im just simply incapable of doing, getting girls, sneaking out and drinking and shit. I'm tired of seeing people in the same hobbies as me, people that I know and they are just alllllllllllllll way fucking better than I am. I'm tired of not being able to cry I just need to let shit out.

this post isnt for pity, I genuinely couldn't give less of a fuck for ""it gets better"" ""dont just expect immediate progress"" ""step out of your comfort zone"" just fuck off this post is a cry for help, how do i make it better? how do i talk to girls how do i motivate my self to go out and skate, how do i get invited to parties?

background shit now? I peaked in 6th or 7th grade I suppose. I used to be able to just flirt with girls without even thinking about it, half way through 7th covid hit and thats where my downfall began, even when i was in 7th grade i still had all the shit im dealing with now, i care too much about what people think about me, im very socially awkward and hate interactions outside of school, (example being going to a friends house) yet im still here and i have a great group of ""friends"" (they are just people i hang out with and we make jokes n shit, i used to be hella funny as well, making everyone laugh all the time but even thats gone downhill a bit,

I'm still funny but now these days i struggle to think of shit its like ive just been shut off. Ive never actually had deep conversations with these people, couple of which ive known since early elementary school :/ anyways, now im just a hella awkward retard running around in 9th grade, I beat the shit out of my dick every day, cant stop, I get attached to random women, never even talk to them or make a move just weowoeoaweo. 2 of my ""best friends"" (people i text somewhat daily) are women, i kinda like them both but i dont want to, they are my friends i dont want to think of them that way, I also have a hard time making eye contact, even when im talking to my dad or my mom, I cant look my mom in the eye at all for some reason just a couple of seconds then ill go look away and do something to play shit off or whatever and make a couple of glances whatever fuck it you dont need everything. this is what i mean, i care too much, im explaining my self to a bunch of redditards on how me not making eye contact with my mom doesnt make me a dick. whatever. anyways most action ive gotten out of women other than making them die on the floor from laughter or whatever in 6th grade, this 1 girl really liked me, problem is im just so fucking incapable of talking to women now that i just couldnt bring myself to go out with her or do anything beyond texting her when she was bored, she also cheated on my best friend and a couple of other kids so yeah, kinda figured she was bad news or whatever as well. nice one.

anyways yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepppp big fucking loser that cant do shit. I have nothing to say ive accomplished or im proud of, ive never heard either of my parents say they are proud of me, (they also have screaming matches every day which is pretty nice), oh i also dont eat breakfast or lunch only dinner roughly 6 times a week (picky eater of course) weweaweoawoewoeaoweoweoaowoeowa I sometimes question the genuinety of my feelings, its hard to explain. best i can say is i make fun of people for shit but then i do the shits then i question the shits i do and waeowoaeoweowaoeo. too hard to explain. my mind is f u c k e d. It would all be so much better if i just fucking shot myself already, ive got access but i just cant even get out of bed to go do that so what the fuck fuck it just sleep and repeat the same fucking shit thats what im tired of as well, every single fucking day is the fucking same it makes me want to fucking shoot myself. I cant fucking get through this same bullshit going to school everyday and coming home at like 4:30 to sleep until dinner then sleep until morning again its fucking bullshit. whatever guess im done ill add on when i find other shit.

again this post isnt for pity or whatever, fuck that shit, i need fucking help. (dont say therapy retards) edit!@!21@$!@$@#%\^$%\^@#$@! i probably mentioned girls an alarming amount so here i go again caring about what people think too much (before you say just stop caring, its not that easy!) anyways im not looking at girls as some random band aid solution or whatever you call it to my problem its just a people thing in general i just want to become more likeable and able to fucking talk and hold a fucking conversation for the love god, if i could just communicate properly like a normal human and get to talking well again then id be fine! i know how to flirt but shit i need an actual conversation first to work off of it right! if i could just get social interaction down then im fucking golden, all id need is the ability to some fuckin eye contact and some ability to express emotion in my face (sometimes im just talking and i dont know exactly what to do with my face i kinda just notice shit like my mouth, ill notice my tongue in my mouth and then start fucking up my words) wjatever! weoweowaeaweweo theres some other shit i forgot so i know ill be back later. (edit 3 i also need to figure out how to get some of that motivation stuff)

another edit this post is absolute aids to read so im just gonna space it out

"I've had anxiety and depression for over ten years, since I was a young teen. I have gone on different meds, seen many different therapists, done CBT, read self help books, group therapy, and stayed in a psych ward.

I've achieved so much, including escaping an abusive home, getting my college and uni degrees, and graduating with honors.

I have a boyfriend I love and a cat I adore.

I'm still struggling and I don't know what to do anymore.

I don't know what to do. I feel so trapped. I have tried so hard to recover and I've gotten better in some ways but I still struggle with deep depression and anxiety. I still have (passive) suicidal thoughts, fatigue and exhaustion (yes, I went to the doctor to verify it wasn't a physical issue), and now I actually feel like my personhood is being erased. By that I mean, what makes me who I am, my hobbies and talents, my hopes and dreams, are fading. I used to read 90+ books a year. Now I barely read at all. I used to write all the time. Now I barely write. I'm rarely excited for anything outside of food anymore. Waking up is a chore. Being around people drains me. I've done the exercise, changing my diet. Religion and spirituality. Meditation.

Never works for long.

I just need some direction from here. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I will suffer this forever, until I fade away and become just a shell.

Depression has no breaks
Life is fucking strange and depressing.  You would think everything would workout  but it never really does.

Growing up as the kid that was most adored in a massive family and the cool kid that was best at a sport, girls are always attracted but I'm always to hesitant cuz I'm too depressed to even approach them. U would think life should be fun in that position but it was never really all that. I was always feeling fucking down for no reason And i was depressed 99% of the time. It triggered even worse when my parents divorced  and which till to this day has a very strong effect. I shut out everything I had even quit the sport which could have taken me to the pros and fucked up all grades and I couldn't talk to anybody bout it. All I though was killing myself but I can not get myself to do it.

I got lucky to study abroad for many years studying something that is highly recognized but even then I dropped out due to my depression. I cannot get myself to see a therapist for Watever reason. Got in amazing shape didn't work. I did all the partying, drinking, sex, drugs but nothing worked. Relationships didn't help, partners cannot get me to snap out of it,
Loving family can not do anything bout it even though I don't talk or show it around them. Toxic relationship till now is making myself very suicidal but I feel like I'm stuck each day .Is there something fucked up in my brain that can never be changed ?",1,depression ha break life fucking strange depressing would think everything would workout never really doe growing kid wa adored massive family cool kid wa best sport girl always attracted always hesitant cuz depressed even approach u would think life fun position wa never really wa always feeling fucking reason wa depressed 99 time triggered even worse parent divorced till day ha strong effect shut everything even quit sport could taken pro fucked grade talk anybody bout though wa killing get got lucky study abroad many year studying something highly recognized even dropped due depression cannot get see therapist watever reason got amazing shape work partying drinking sex drug nothing worked relationship help partner cannot get snap loving family anything bout even though talk show around toxic relationship till making suicidal feel like stuck day something fucked brain never changed,depression ha break life fucking strange depressing would think everything would workout never really doe growing kid wa adored massive family cool kid wa best sport girl always attracted always hesitant cuz depressed even approach u would think life fun position wa never really wa always feeling fucking reason wa depressed 99 time triggered even worse parent divorced till day ha strong effect shut everything even quit sport could taken pro fucked grade talk anybody bout though wa killing get got lucky study abroad many year studying something highly recognized even dropped due depression cannot get see therapist watever reason got amazing shape work partying drinking sex drug nothing worked relationship help partner cannot get snap loving family anything bout even though talk show around toxic relationship till making suicidal feel like stuck day something fucked brain never changed
"I don't really know if this is the right sub but I am just sad and I feel so alone. I have been battling depression since I was 14 and some days are good some like today I just can't stop crying. I have friends but I never want to bother them with how I feel. I know it is too much and I can't put that burden on them. I'm married and when I married my husband I thought I was marrying someone who understood how I felt and how some days are just bad ones. But it seems like lately, all he does is get mad at me when I am feeling down. He keeps telling me it's too much and he can't handle all my feelings. But I can't handle them either that's why I need support. I am just left feeling like a burden.  I don't want to feel like this. I want to have good days but I can't pull myself out of this pit. I want to be a good wife but some days it's hard to make myself clean the house or take adequate care of our dog or make it to the grocery store. When I am feeling down I pull away from everyone and all I want to do is lay in bed or in the shower. But as I lay in my self pitty all I can think about is I wish my husband was here to comfort me. But he won't he never does. That's all I want, to feel comforted by the man I love most but all I feel like when I'm sad is that I'm so broken no one can ever fix me. I know it's just my depression talking but it's the only voice I hear. I wish I wasn't so alone and sad all the time. I know it can be draining but it hurts me too. I just want to be good enough and I feel like I never will be. The littlest things can send me into a spiral of just toxic thoughts. A small fight with my husband can lead to an entire night of just crying. All I ever want is to lay in my bed and just exist. I don't want to leave this world yet because I know it gets better and that it is just a rough day. But it's just getting harder to pick myself up. I'm losing the motivation to do that. I wish I wasn't but sometimes it just feels like it would be easier for everyone if I just ran away so I don't burden anyone else. I just want to be happy and I feel like that will never happen. My job has less meaning to me now I don't really care about it anymore and I just want to be at home and stay away from everyone so I don't make their lives any harder. I don't feel like myself anymore but when I think about it I have no idea who I am. I am just a wife with a meaningless job. I don't have dreams or ambitions I just exist. All I ever have wanted in my life was to be a mom but the idea of having a baby terrifies me. What if I pass depression on to my baby? What if I'm not a good mom? What if postpartum depression just absolutely wrecks me? What if I can't care for my baby because I am too depressed to get out of bed. I  just don't know how to stop the spiraling of my depression thoughts. I just want to feel okay and I don't know how. I'm sorry this turned into a long rant but it feels better to get this off my chest. I know things will get better and I just have to fight through it I am just so tired.

On the other hand, I can’t be in a relationship. I’m not vulnerable enough. I don’t talk about my negative feelings to anyone bc it seems pointless. I know I couldn’t be in a happy, stable relationship unless I lied. Even I know that’s wrong.

"I’ve been with my partner for about 4 years. I didn’t know they were depressed for the first year, and even after that it wasn’t really showing until the last two years. About ½ a year ago, their father passed, he was the only good influence and person of any help in their life. They are crushed. I’ve done what I can, emotionally and financially, but whenever they get down they lash out and can’t be reasoned with. Temper tantrums, breaking things, screaming. Sometimes it lasts for weeks. They recently got served for debt collection and now have no money to spend when they were already hand to mouth. This was a tipping point, and I can’t handle it anymore.

I take hot showers and often stand there still just feeling it. Same thing with drinks. I drink a lot of water and unfortunately hot water alone isn’t the best so I compensate by drinking a lot of non-caffeine tea and a little coffee.

"Life sucks. I Try to do all of the work that is required to feel ok, I take my meds every day now. But I still feel like I’m worthless and a burden to others. 

As the title says I’m a 25 year old male college drop out (if you count doing and failing a semester with a work load of one class) who lives at home with my mom and younger brother. And sadly I have to relay on the kindness of my parents for money for things like medicine (only after a car accident last year), insurance for my car, and phone bill(only because it was part of my parents separation agreement when I was younger/my dad still pays it as he sees it as a good compensation for not being around during my childhood🙃)

I also have a job to pay for things like food, clothing, gas, entertainment, credit card bills, medical bills and all of my needs. But it’s hard to work when you suffer from short term memory loss, epilepsy induced by stress flashing lights, heat and just being not on my medication. But I don’t want to go on disability as I need something like work to make me feel like I’m doing something with my life. 

I’d love to go back to college but I can’t even get a loan to go back to community with my credit score. I’m scared to get a full time job again because the last one’s stress resulted in me assaulting cops in hopes that they would shoot and kill me. But that didn’t work, I was sent to a psych ward for that. I just feel like a failure in what ever I do. 

It doesn’t help living with people who don’t understand you and put you down for not being further a long in life. So I try to stay away from home when I’m awake. But you can only spend so much time at a friends house before you overstay your welcome.",1,life suck try work required feel ok take med every day still feel like worthless burden others title say 25 year old male college drop count failing semester work load one class life home mom younger brother sadly relay kindness parent money thing like medicine car accident last year insurance car phone bill wa part parent separation agreement wa younger dad still pay see good compensation around childhood also job pay thing like food clothing gas entertainment credit card bill medical bill need hard work suffer short term memory loss epilepsy induced stress flashing light heat medication want go disability need something like work make feel like something life love go back college even get loan go back community credit score scared get full time job last one stress resulted assaulting cop hope would shoot kill work wa sent psych ward feel like failure ever help living people understand put long life try stay away home awake spend much time friend house overstay welcome,life suck try work required feel ok take med every day still feel like worthless burden others title say 25 year old male college drop count failing semester work load one class life home mom younger brother sadly relay kindness parent money thing like medicine car accident last year insurance car phone bill wa part parent separation agreement wa younger dad still pay see good compensation around childhood also job pay thing like food clothing gas entertainment credit card bill medical bill need hard work suffer short term memory loss epilepsy induced stress flashing light heat medication want go disability need something like work make feel like something life love go back college even get loan go back community credit score scared get full time job last one stress resulted assaulting cop hope would shoot kill work wa sent psych ward feel like failure ever help living people understand put long life try stay away home awake spend much time friend house overstay welcome
"It's a bad one today. One of the worst it's been in a long time. It's hard to move or even talk. There's this cotton stuffed in my chest and a weight on it so big it's hard to breathe.

The house is a mess and my wife asked me to simply pick up the floor so she can sweep and clean carpets. One thing. I had to tell her I couldn't.

One thing. One. And I can't.

I feel so useless. 

We have bills overdue. Our dogs are out of food. I'm not sure I can even force myself to go to work today. I know that once I get moving I will feel better. I know this like I know my own hands. But the weight on my shoulders and in my chest makes it hard to think of even getting out of bed to get food.

I'm not hungry anyways.

"Firstly, my mind is going a million miles a minute and I have a lot to say so bare with me. Also this is mostly meant to be as a way to get this stuff off of my chest, but I will also gladly accept any advice.

So, I use self depricating humor a lot. It's one of my go to styles of humor when with my friends or family and it tends to get some good laughs, and I even laugh along. But I've recently kind of realized that as I make these jokes, I'm only saying what I really believe with a humorous tone in my voice, as if to say ""Don't worry guys it's all a joke.""  And of course everybody knowing that that type of humor is common for me, they've stopped asking if I'm okay a long time ago, and I'm finding it difficult now to bring it up and tell everybody that my jokes aren't really jokes anymore. I'm not even sure what I'd tell them or where to begin. For as long as I can remember I've been unhappy with myself, both physically and with my own personality. I've lost any and all confidence I once had. I spend everyday inside at home unless I'm at work, if I've managed to hold a job for longer than a month or 2 and 9/10 times I have a hard time holding conversations because my mind goes blank except for trying to figure out ways to escape the conversation and go back to solitude or at least being around someone else I've known for a long time and am comfortable around. 

I can't even read my own emotions anymore, as far as I can tell every feeling just feels..bad, uncomfortable, upsetting, or otherwise generally crappy. I worry that if I can't even tell how I'm feeling anymore then I won't be able to tell others and get the proper help. I mean, I do have a therapist but usually when I show up my mind goes back to being blank on all the things I wanted to talk about over the week and I end up telling her ""it was just another usually boring week"" and responding to her questions about how I fetl or what I'm thinking with ""I don't know"". At this point I'm just afraid that I'm too far gone. Also, I'm too afraid of going to a hospital for help, I've tried before but it freaks me out and I wind up lying my way through for them to get me out asap. Longest was one night. I want to get better, but I'd prefer to do it in a way that I'm comfortable with, so I'm saving hospitalization as an absolute last ditch effort at this point.",1,firstly mind going million mile minute lot say bare also mostly meant way get stuff chest also gladly accept advice use self depricating humor lot one go style humor friend family tends get good laugh even laugh along recently kind realized make joke saying really believe humorous tone voice say worry guy joke course everybody knowing type humor common stopped asking okay long time ago finding difficult bring tell everybody joke really joke anymore even sure tell begin long remember unhappy physically personality lost confidence spend everyday inside home unless work managed hold job longer month 2 9 10 time hard time holding conversation mind go blank except trying figure way escape conversation go back solitude least around someone else known long time comfortable around even read emotion anymore far tell every feeling feel bad uncomfortable upsetting otherwise generally crappy worry even tell feeling anymore able tell others get proper help mean therapist usually show mind go back blank thing wanted talk week end telling wa another usually boring week responding question fetl thinking know point afraid far gone also afraid going hospital help tried freak wind lying way get asap longest wa one night want get better prefer way comfortable saving hospitalization absolute last ditch effort point,firstly mind going million mile minute lot say bare also mostly meant way get stuff chest also gladly accept advice use self depricating humor lot one go style humor friend family tends get good laugh even laugh along recently kind realized make joke saying really believe humorous tone voice say worry guy joke course everybody knowing type humor common stopped asking okay long time ago finding difficult bring tell everybody joke really joke anymore even sure tell begin long remember unhappy physically personality lost confidence spend everyday inside home unless work managed hold job longer month 2 9 10 time hard time holding conversation mind go blank except trying figure way escape conversation go back solitude least around someone else known long time comfortable around even read emotion anymore far tell every feeling feel bad uncomfortable upsetting otherwise generally crappy worry even tell feeling anymore able tell others get proper help mean therapist usually show mind go back blank thing wanted talk week end telling wa another usually boring week responding question fetl thinking know point afraid far gone also afraid going hospital help tried freak wind lying way get asap longest wa one night want get better prefer way comfortable saving hospitalization absolute last ditch effort point
"I feel utterly alone all of the time, and this in turn makes me depressed. That being said, I don't want to be around anyone, almost ever. Most interactions I have, either with friends or strangers, I find it increasingly hard to care about what they're saying, and I feel the bare minimum if not absolutely no empathy whatsoever. I hate being aware of this because it only serves to make me feel so isolated, especially because people that love me think of me as a caring and sensitive person, which I was. I'm sure I feel this way as a result of all the trauma I've gone through in the past few years, but I don't know how to fix it. Therapy wasn't helping, and I even felt myself lying to my therapist at times because I wanted to seem ""normal"" (guess I'm bad at asking for help even when I \*am\* seeking help). Meds didn't seem to help either. It's hard for me to feel joy, and I don't remember the last time I was genuinely excited for something. If I were to make a cheesy visual analogy — everything is in black and white now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long read, but has anyone else gone through something like this? Will it end?

"I have always been the therapist of the group. If people wanted to vent about there problems they would come to me. There is a friend in my group of friends who also suffers from depression. So I talk to her a lot about her problems.

But the thing is I myself am suffering from depression for almost 5 years now. I never talked to anybody about it and just keep it for myself. Maybe because I feel like I don’t want to bother other people with my problems.

This year it got a lot worse and I opened up about it to the friend who is also suffering from depression. I thought she would understand it and maybe we could talk about it.

But instead of understanding she just laughed. Because how the fuck can I be depressed. The therapist of the group, the “stable” one. She said that if I was depressed than she would be already dead. 

It’s been a month now after she said that to me. I think about it almost every day and it still hurts.

This is the second time I opened up about my depression. I know it’s not really a question or something but I really needed to tell someone.

"            I have a lot of unexpected baggage that came with learning a language on a conversational level. I'll try to keep it short. My (once) struggling poor white mom was estranged from the main family household  in a really small town in the U.S. She wanted to have her son (me) to have a better life and picked the best single hispanic man (in her situation) to help fill in the gap of me being fatherless and in tandem expose me to another culture within said small town.  I was 9 years old when that happened. Flash forward , I'm 17 had foreign exchange to chile and made meaningful memories and got to level where I could talk with any patient Spanish speaker with grammatical prestige; however, later that year, one of the main individuals who inspired me to learn met a terrible fate.

          His name was Hector. A hard-working Venezuelan dad working as a construction manager and builder. He brought life, laughter, hardwork, and love wherever he went. But I knew his life wasn't easy, he had family still in Venezuela struggling with the inflation crisis. He had a divorce with his wife from the states and their daughter was struggling to make ends meet, even with roommates in a high rent county. He was busting his ass to help the people he loved at a job I believe he was way too old to work in despite his strength. He had a seizure on the work site. In the past when he was younger, he suffered a severe concussion in the gym that ended him up in the hospital. This made his seissure worse and had him end up as a vegetable in the hospital. Those who loved him knew that he had problems with substance abuse in order to work harder and believe that he was on something at the work place that day. One of the most caring, giving, and inspiring fathers I've ever met, paid the price for trying to gift more than one could give. 

          The haunting thing is, the doctors in the hospital can't really tell how much of him is their lying with expressionless looks on the hospital bed. A family friend gone in a moments notice in a horrible way, such a thing I could never really prepare for. To add insult to injury, my mother divorced my Mexican stepfather a month prior before the incident. In addition, my connection with Spanish friends overseas decayed. Then covid hit and eventually Hector's daughter had to make the choice of pulling his plug to be merciful at the end of familial closure or bade on hope that the doctors find some way to help him. I'm friends with her and it was a choice I do not envy her, but the decision is finally coming close. I know this might seem selfish but I am struggling to maintain my Spanish level let alone improve it. It has definitely declined as a result of other events and I know reading, speaking, writing, and seeing Spanish related things is a way but there is a collection of grief holding me back that brings me down with a fog of depression whenever I try to pick it back up. It trying to make me relive such traumas and it is amplified by my work where I deal with the struggling immigrant.

"I don't know where exactly things went wrong for me. I had never been comfortable with myself and I'd always hated the idea of being alone with myself. I don't know why I'm so unhappy with the way I am because I don't even have an excuse to be, there are people with much worse circumstances. I used work and friends to keep myself distracted from being with myself but it got to the point that I just couldn't keep up with it. I stopped reaching out to people because I just couldn't force myself to make the effort anymore and I've lost almost everyone, I also just don't have it in me to flog myself to work anymore. I had/have a relationship that is suffering and about to end because I hate myself to the point I push my partner away. I feel like I don't deserve a partner with how pathetic I am. I see everyone else being happy with their lot and I don't know why I can't find any peace or contentment with mine. I burned out from working to keep this shallow life of mine going which was keeping me from facing all this hate within myself for me. I've fallen behind all my other batchmates because I can't find it in me to keep going anymore and that makes me even more miserable. I can't do anything, people say I need to learn to love myself but everytime I look at myself I see this miserable, weak, pathetic semi man-child that doesn't deserve love. I shouldn't be so unable to control my negativity, I shouldn't be so weak that I concoct unhappiness out of nothing and use it to paralyze myself. I don't have any excuse to be feeling like crap and that makes me feel even more like crap because I know that there's no justification for it. I feel like I'm just sitting on my ass doing nothing now and everything else in my life is moving on while I'm slipping away because now I'm just too tired to keep up my act and keep doing whatever I can to somehow not think about how much I hate myself. I don't think I have a right to feel this way because it's all self inflicted and it's stupid because I should've been able to be more in control, but no matter matter what I do I can't help but feel this way. My partner tells me it's all self pity and I should man up, I don't know how to.

"**TW: Sexual Harassment, General Abuse**

It's 130am and I've been bombarded by a rollercoaster of emotions for the last couple of hours. My trigger today was something that a cousin I haven't heard from in a long time said. It was overly sexual.He is a gay man &amp; has been with his partner, now husband, for more than 15 years or so. I am a straight man and I am confident enough in my sexuality to be my authentic self without worrying about what others will say. My cousin, however, seems to think that because I am so confident, I must be a closeted bisexual or homosexual.

He has taken it upon himself to tell me about all the men he's secretly cheated on his husband with, how a man sucking my dick will be more pleasurable than a woman and told me about some website where he does live sex with other men and asked me if I wanted to see one of the men. He then commented that ""straight men are the only men that he is attracted to"" and tried to tell me about all the straight men he's been chatting with on a million different apps. I stopped him there and went home. This has led me to remember repressed memories of him doing the same thing when I was younger (thankfully nothing else), as well as leading me to the realisation that my family (who are mostly narcissists) will never believe me if I told them about it. Either that or they will find a way to pass off his indecency as a joke and expect me to be on board with it instead of being bitchy.

I'm unsure where I go from here. I know that I definitely want to cut that cousin off for good and that's  already being done. I just feel so lost and frankly disgusted. I have gay and bi friends who would be very ""bromantic"" with me without it being uncomfortable because I trust them, they respect my sexuality and we all know it's all good fun and games between friends. I have zero problems with anyone's sexual orientation. That is a very personal matter and it is none of my business. However, it becomes a problem if you try to force it upon me and not respect my sexuality, just like my cousin did.I was completely blindsided by it.

I'm now at the point where I can't sleep because it has consumed my thoughts and I've spiralled back into a dark place after remembering it's not the first time he made those comments to me.",1,tw sexual harassment general abuse 130am bombarded rollercoaster emotion last couple hour trigger today wa something cousin heard long time said wa overly sexual gay man amp ha partner husband 15 year straight man confident enough sexuality authentic self without worrying others say cousin however seems think confident must closeted bisexual homosexual ha taken upon tell men secretly cheated husband man sucking dick pleasurable woman told website doe live sex men asked wanted see one men commented straight men men attracted tried tell straight men chatting million different apps stopped went home ha led remember repressed memory thing wa younger thankfully nothing else well leading realisation family mostly narcissist never believe told either find way pas indecency joke expect board instead bitchy unsure go know definitely want cut cousin good already done feel lost frankly disgusted gay bi friend would bromantic without uncomfortable trust respect sexuality know good fun game friend zero problem anyone sexual orientation personal matter none business however becomes problem try force upon respect sexuality like cousin wa completely blindsided point sleep ha consumed thought spiralled back dark place remembering first time made comment,tw sexual harassment general abuse 130am bombarded rollercoaster emotion last couple hour trigger today wa something cousin heard long time said wa overly sexual gay man amp ha partner husband 15 year straight man confident enough sexuality authentic self without worrying others say cousin however seems think confident must closeted bisexual homosexual ha taken upon tell men secretly cheated husband man sucking dick pleasurable woman told website doe live sex men asked wanted see one men commented straight men men attracted tried tell straight men chatting million different apps stopped went home ha led remember repressed memory thing wa younger thankfully nothing else well leading realisation family mostly narcissist never believe told either find way pas indecency joke expect board instead bitchy unsure go know definitely want cut cousin good already done feel lost frankly disgusted gay bi friend would bromantic without uncomfortable trust respect sexuality know good fun game friend zero problem anyone sexual orientation personal matter none business however becomes problem try force upon respect sexuality like cousin wa completely blindsided point sleep ha consumed thought spiralled back dark place remembering first time made comment
Ok so this will be a long one not expecting anyone to respond or even read the whole thing I just want to put this somewhere. I’m a Trans ftm guy and I just feel depressed all the fucking time like nothing I do makes me happy anymore you know the classic. I have major self esteem issues and it doesn’t help I have major gender dysphoria as well. I have thoughts of suicide next to everyday. Once and a while I will forget about my problems but they always come back. I have a single and abusive mother that has made my life miserable along with a few other people in my family who put me down and never let me talk about my problems but dump their own on me. None of them know I’m trans so I’m dead named and called by she/her everyday. My few friends all most likely think I’m flaky or weird. I barely ever get out of bed and when I do I’m tired and unfriendly. I don’t know what to do if this continues I might just off myself because why the fuck does anything matter anymore. One good thing was I have a crush per se on a gay trans dude but my friends say I have no chance with him so why try and I agree if I’m going to kms I might as well do it soon. Please don’t say I am just an angsty teenager because yeah I’m 16 but I feel that is just an excuse to write off my depression and everything as a hormone thing and maybe but my circumstances are truly awful and no one can say otherwise unless in the same position. That’s all I have to say. Hope people who read this whole thing have a good day. :),1,ok long one expecting anyone respond even read whole thing want put somewhere trans ftm guy feel depressed fucking time like nothing make happy anymore know classic major self esteem issue help major gender dysphoria well thought suicide next everyday forget problem always come back single abusive mother ha made life miserable along people family put never let talk problem dump none know trans dead named called everyday friend likely think flaky weird barely ever get bed tired unfriendly know continues might fuck doe anything matter anymore one good thing wa crush per se gay trans dude friend say chance try agree going km might well soon please say angsty teenager yeah 16 feel excuse write depression everything hormone thing maybe circumstance truly awful one say otherwise unless position say hope people read whole thing good day,ok long one expecting anyone respond even read whole thing want put somewhere trans ftm guy feel depressed fucking time like nothing make happy anymore know classic major self esteem issue help major gender dysphoria well thought suicide next everyday forget problem always come back single abusive mother ha made life miserable along people family put never let talk problem dump none know trans dead named called everyday friend likely think flaky weird barely ever get bed tired unfriendly know continues might fuck doe anything matter anymore one good thing wa crush per se gay trans dude friend say chance try agree going km might well soon please say angsty teenager yeah 16 feel excuse write depression everything hormone thing maybe circumstance truly awful one say otherwise unless position say hope people read whole thing good day

"This is my first time posting here but I feel so lost and like I’m going crazy. 

I got a new doctor…new doctor gave me a trial of new meds because I expressed concern of current meds not working like they should anymore.

This past month has been awful. It was fine at first, then 2 weeks later I was nauseous all the time, not being able to sleep much then of course sleeping for 12+ hours a day (where I’m currently at). I was seriously so out of it, I had the grand idea to quit my job for something else (not like me to be spontaneous). Of course, I can’t see anyone until my appt cause there isn’t any other openings. I went off the meds myself after not being able to get a refill cause of insurance (thank goodness I had my other prescription still). 

I feel so lost right now. I feel like my life is just going and I’m just along for the ride. I feel like a robot, sometimes I feel like I’m outside of my body. Lately I just want to spend all day in bed with my spouse holding me tight and forget everyone and everything. It doesn’t help the economy is effecting us so badly. It doesn’t help that we barely have money to make ends meet. 

I don’t wanna die, I just don’t wanna live like this. I failed. I know I did. All my dreams were crushed young, I don’t even know what I can do because I was told I was too stupid. I don’t want my current job, but it’s what I have. I don’t trust anyone, not medical, not govt, not even neighbors who act like they care.

Man I’ve been suffering recently but today pushed me to the edge. I was using regaine which is extremely poisonous even in small doses for cats but it doesn’t mention it anywhere on the packaging so I had no idea. Afterwards I was playing with their kitten and it probably got on her fur and the she licked it off. A little while later I noticed she was acting a bit weird and looked pretty lethargic so I googled it and found out about it’s toxicity and took her to the vet. She’s there now but they have no way of knowing how much she ingested so they don’t know if she’ll be alright. It’s fucking destroying me and I can’t stop crying,1,man suffering recently today pushed edge wa using regaine extremely poisonous even small dos cat mention anywhere packaging idea afterwards wa playing kitten probably got fur licked little later noticed wa acting bit weird looked pretty lethargic googled found toxicity took vet way knowing much ingested know alright fucking destroying stop cry,man suffering recently today pushed edge wa using regaine extremely poisonous even small dos cat mention anywhere packaging idea afterwards wa playing kitten probably got fur licked little later noticed wa acting bit weird looked pretty lethargic googled found toxicity took vet way knowing much ingested know alright fucking destroying stop cry

"My mum and I were speaking about chores and she started to get mad because I apparently don’t do my chores well, things escalated and she started to say things like “she’s tired of a messy house” and “she doesn’t live for her kids anymore”. The whole time I made sure not to say a WORD because she would’ve seen it as an attack.

Somehow we got onto the topic of my distant dad and she called him lucky because he “doesn’t have to deal with this shit”. Then she told me the last words he said before he left  were “you have no idea how tough things are going to be with those kids”

Firstly, that makes ZERO sense to me because when he left we were all under the age of 13, literally kids. Kids will be kids, unless he was a wizard I don’t understand how he “saw into the future.” Secondly, i’m trying to not let it affect me but it hurt. After the things he did and when he left I stopped liking that man, but knowing that he didn’t even like us has awoken a feeling i’ve never felt before.

It’s a shitty feeling and a shitty situation, however I just wanted to rant and i’m probably gonna sleep cause it’s past 12am. if you read this you’re cool, if you didn’t you’re still cool",1,mum speaking chore started get mad apparently chore well thing escalated started say thing like tired messy house live kid anymore whole time made sure say word would seen attack somehow got onto topic distant dad called lucky deal shit told last word said left idea tough thing going kid firstly make zero sense left age 13 literally kid kid kid unless wa wizard understand saw future secondly trying let affect hurt thing left stopped liking man knowing even like u ha awoken feeling never felt shitty feeling shitty situation however wanted rant probably gonna sleep cause past 12am read cool still cool,mum speaking chore started get mad apparently chore well thing escalated started say thing like tired messy house live kid anymore whole time made sure say word would seen attack somehow got onto topic distant dad called lucky deal shit told last word said left idea tough thing going kid firstly make zero sense left age 13 literally kid kid kid unless wa wizard understand saw future secondly trying let affect hurt thing left stopped liking man knowing even like u ha awoken feeling never felt shitty feeling shitty situation however wanted rant probably gonna sleep cause past 12am read cool still cool
"This is probably the most embarrassing post I’ve ever made, but I need help. I’ve been working my way through a depressive episode for the past couple months, and I thought I was doing fairly good with it, since I’ve been showering fairly often (at least every other day) and eating at least once a day, but recently one of my friends messaged me privately to ask if I was okay, because the last few times he saw me, he said he smelled a “strong body odor” and it was making him not want to be around me. I immediately went and bought some men’s deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this. Honestly I’m just upset that I let it get bad enough for people to notice, and I keep wondering how many people have been choosing to just say nothing and deal with it.

For some that could be that girl with short skirts and goosebumps on her naked legs.. For some that could be that fancy man, who walks by you with black coat wearing his best perfume. In both situations you turn your head back, when they pass you... But have you ever enjoyed how wind is shaking off those colorful leaves? Have you ever seen little leaf tornado in front of you?
Have you ever felt difference between summer and autumn air?
Why we feel more depressed in autumn, maybe it's because it's getting colder outside, winter is coming. And we, as a human beings with feelings want someone near us.  We want those warm touches on our cold skin.. We want some hot summer memories to share with.. We want someone to kiss and snuggle next to fireplace.
Wind... It's windy outside.  And my sanity is barely hanging just like those few leaves that are left on those branches...",1,wind windy birch next window loosing orange leaf green leaf change color staying strong holding dear life like u hard time holding amongst leaf holding stay sane healthy happy like autumn wear warm soft sweater hide behind scarf hard feel full big world even harder find thing make u happy could girl short skirt goosebump naked leg could fancy man walk black coat wearing best perfume situation turn head back pas ever enjoyed wind shaking colorful leaf ever seen little leaf tornado front ever felt difference summer autumn air feel depressed autumn maybe getting colder outside winter coming human feeling want someone near u want warm touch cold skin want hot summer memory share want someone kiss snuggle next fireplace wind windy outside sanity barely hanging like leaf left branch,wind windy birch next window loosing orange leaf green leaf change color staying strong holding dear life like u hard time holding amongst leaf holding stay sane healthy happy like autumn wear warm soft sweater hide behind scarf hard feel full big world even harder find thing make u happy could girl short skirt goosebump naked leg could fancy man walk black coat wearing best perfume situation turn head back pas ever enjoyed wind shaking colorful leaf ever seen little leaf tornado front ever felt difference summer autumn air feel depressed autumn maybe getting colder outside winter coming human feeling want someone near u want warm touch cold skin want hot summer memory share want someone kiss snuggle next fireplace wind windy outside sanity barely hanging like leaf left branch
"My life is difficult at the moment. I am a father to two children (4 and 1) and work a job in a field I strive to get into for years.

My job has started to change in ways that make it worse and more difficult. My pay is meagre. On the money I earn, I will never afford a house, a nice car, holidays, or any of the other material items I'd like to own. It is also incredibly draining.

I come home from work and my children can be difficult, and take a lot of work. I am burnt out.

On top of this, my partner and I are working through some struggles that I have caused. Our relationship is somewhat stable but she is depressed because of things I've done, and so am I.

My work is in a sector I dreamed about being a part of, in the music industry, but it is at such a low and removed level that I'm starting to really see my limitations, and realise that I might not be cut out for it. I no longer enjoy music. 

I'm dealing with bitterness at other peoples success. I covet things they have and feel like a total failure. Whilst on paper, I might not be, I just feel totally worthless. 

I really dislike everything about who I am. My friendships have fallen apart due to age and differing life stages. I have no energy or motivation and feel totally stuck. Every day is the same - do my job that I dont enjoy, come home and deal with a stressful situation and then when the kids are asleep, I am drained. Then, I am woken in the morning by my children. 

I am so intensely depressed, and have been on antidepressants several times to no avail. I have no drive or energy, and am considering quitting my musical aspirations, partly for the relief of having no dream that can make me feel 'not good enough'.

I feel not good enough in every area of my life. Mentally, physically, emotionally, in work, in my relationship, personally. I live my whole life pretending I'm ok.

I've spoken to my partner. I've had counselling. I am just so done, and I really don't know what my next step is. Do I commit to trying more with music only to feel like a failure even more? Do I quit music entirely, having no other real interests, hobbies or aspirations?",1,life difficult moment father two child 4 1 work job field strive get year job ha started change way make worse difficult pay meagre money earn never afford house nice car holiday material item like also incredibly draining come home work child difficult take lot work burnt top partner working struggle caused relationship somewhat stable depressed thing done work sector dreamed part music industry low removed level starting really see limitation realise might cut longer enjoy music dealing bitterness people success covet thing feel like total failure whilst paper might feel totally worthless really dislike everything friendship fallen apart due age differing life stage energy motivation feel totally stuck every day job dont enjoy come home deal stressful situation kid asleep drained woken morning child intensely depressed antidepressant several time avail drive energy considering quitting musical aspiration partly relief dream make feel good enough feel good enough every area life mentally physically emotionally work relationship personally live whole life pretending ok spoken partner counselling done really know next step commit trying music feel like failure even quit music entirely real interest hobby aspiration,life difficult moment father two child 4 1 work job field strive get year job ha started change way make worse difficult pay meagre money earn never afford house nice car holiday material item like also incredibly draining come home work child difficult take lot work burnt top partner working struggle caused relationship somewhat stable depressed thing done work sector dreamed part music industry low removed level starting really see limitation realise might cut longer enjoy music dealing bitterness people success covet thing feel like total failure whilst paper might feel totally worthless really dislike everything friendship fallen apart due age differing life stage energy motivation feel totally stuck every day job dont enjoy come home deal stressful situation kid asleep drained woken morning child intensely depressed antidepressant several time avail drive energy considering quitting musical aspiration partly relief dream make feel good enough feel good enough every area life mentally physically emotionally work relationship personally live whole life pretending ok spoken partner counselling done really know next step commit trying music feel like failure even quit music entirely real interest hobby aspiration
"In 48 to 72 hours, I will begin taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day, which will be my first time taking a pharmaceutical medicine for anxiety and depression, after my twelve-step program sponsor encouraged me to do so, and after my mother -- a psychiatric nurse encouraged me to do so.  


I have a robust support system, and for over seven years, I have regularly engaged in a myriad of modalities to address anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, and a pattern of burnout, including but not limited to cognitive behavioral therapy, two twelve-step programs, different forms of meditation, various mindfulness practices, hatha yoga, bhakti yoga, weightlifting, high-intensity interval training, long-distance running, reading books on personal development and introspection, different forms of journaling, a myriad of support groups, numerous supplements, psychedelics, etc. As one of my hatha yoga instructors has stated, I ""do all the things.""   


I have chosen to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for many reasons.  


It seems to have minimal side effects in most people; based on my research and conversations with my psychiatrist and other doctors, it does not lead to some of the side effects that I am most concerned about, like weight gain, and it seems to be a manageable introduction to psychiatric medicine.   


Moreover, all of the previously-mentioned modalities have changed my life for the better since 2014. Still, a destructive and potentially life-threatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help.  


The pattern is as follows: I feel resentful about people that have intentionally or unintentionally harmed me in the past, I feel anxiety and shame about my finances, inconsistent income (that pays well when I do get paid) and the cost of living in downtown Toronto, I feel anxiety, guilt, and shame about my partial dependency on my parents and a myriad of other things, I feel anxiety concerning many nuances of operating two businesses while starting a third, I feel anxiety, shame, and guilt concerning my lack of a dating life (and sexual anorexia/the unconscious avoidance of dating), so I double-down on activities related to my businesses, I double-down on the seemingly beneficial and health activities that I previously mentioned, I work incredibly hard, going past my physical and psychological limits, I soothe myself by doing high-volumes of seemingly good things, I burnout, and then I become depressed, I experience suicidal ideation, and then I engage in self-soothing by raging, ruminating about my resentments, having sex with so-called ""high end"" escorts aka prostitutes, and binge eating processed food. 

This pattern happens about once or twice per month; it takes at least a couple of days to recover from, it is pretty destructive, and nothing that I have done since 2014 has put a permanent stop to it. I meditate every day, and I engage in the activities mentioned above every day, yet I often find myself in the same place.   


With that said, I have a few specific questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, and I am hopeful that someone through Reddit will answer them for me, as the pharmacist that dispensed the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg could not answer some of my questions.  


1. Meditating in sensory deprivation chambers/float chambers for an hour or longer, after taking 0.4 g to 1.2 g of psilocybin (psychedelic mushrooms), has been hugely beneficial to me for seven years, sometimes doing so is the only thing that gets me out of burnout. Still, there is little to no research on how psilocybin interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking psilocybin within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day?  


2. I am a daily cannabis user, usually vaporizing high CBD cannabis through a Pax 3 vaporizer. I have no problem stopping my cannabis use while I experiment with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. Still, there is little to no research on how cannabis interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking cannabis within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day?  


3. I learned that some people could experience mania or suicidal ideation while taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. In some cases, the individual experiences mania or suicidal ideation may not determine that they are in danger, so how can I tell if I begin experiencing such side-effects and what can I do to keep myself safe if I start experiencing such side-effects?  

4.

"This is long so please bear with me

My longtime 'friend' and I just signed a lease and moved into a townhome.  I'm 23 and this is my first time away from home.  I've been meaning to get out for a while, just havent found the right opportunity.  Friends would offer over the years, this one included, and I'd flirt with the idea, but back out cause of gut feelings.  I also got denied on my own cause of criminal background and no rent history.  

In retrospect, I dont know if it would've been impossible for me to get my own place, but it would've been a challenge.  When my friend asked me this year, my internal reaction was 'no.'  Ive even contemplated my relationship with this dude in the past but forgave him.  I thought, 'fuck it, dudes financially stable, got good credit, I need to get out on my own, i should try the roomate thing out.'  It made so much sense looking back on it but its hitting me harder than ever that I ignored my instincts and might be screwed.  

I'm trying to tough it out for now cause I dont wanna hate this experience but it's almost impossible.  The feelings of homesickness away from my mom and cat are natural but shouldn't this simultaneously feel good? Like this makes no sense when I explain it to people.  Hes not a bad guy, always pays his rent and certainly isnt violent or dangerous, but I dont like his company nearly as much as I thought I would.  Like I cant get through to him emotionally, like theres hella facets of me he cant understand.  Plus I dont like the place either.  It feels like a lot of this was his idea but obviously it's on me for agreeing. 

 I've vented to my parents about this and they keep telling me 'try it out for a month, if you cant stand it theres ways out.'  I wanna believe them and maybe they're right but this isnt a movie
  I signed a lease and for now I'm stuck.  I'm not looking for a pity party but I'm in internal hell and just looking for some support or advice cause this sucks.

"After almost 10 years of battling depression and anxiety I was doing so much better. Got the feeling for the first time that things may actually be ok, and life can be enjoyable.
I decided to open up, and look around for friendship.
I have never regretted anything so much in my life. I met people I thought were just amazing. They became like family to me. I opened myself up, trusted them completely. All of them just used me, and left me. A person I truly loved and believed they will be a part of my life for ever, hurt me deeply. They did not even cared I tried to commit suicide after they broke me. I was just a joke to them all along.

"This is a genuine question. I know it is, and I know things will get better, but I feel like after what I’ve lost I’m not going to find anything that will ever make me happy. Everything just feels mundane and joyless and like nothing matters. Cliché things like “it will be better over time” and “you just have to learn to enjoy the small things” just aren’t working. I really want to just feel again.

"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since high school and feel like it’s kept me stuck in a rut for a long time. Being depressed overwhelmed my personality until I thought symptoms of my depression (being sluggish and unmotivated, being antisocial, having very flat moods, and overeating for comfort) were actually parts of my personality. I don’t know how, but I had this lightbulb moment yesterday where I was able to identify my depression and anxiety as outside voices and was able to shut them out. I realized I’d been letting those voices control me to the point that I was avoiding things I loved doing because depression and anxiety told me not to. Being social and outgoing feels like it goes against my natural instincts right now, but every time I successfully talk to a stranger I prove those voices wrong and I actually feel a lot better over all. I don’t know if anyone else can relate, but treating my depression as an outside voice instead of part of my personality has really started to help me deal with it.",1,struggled depression anxiety since high school feel like kept stuck rut long time depressed overwhelmed personality thought symptom depression sluggish unmotivated antisocial flat mood overeating comfort actually part personality know lightbulb moment yesterday wa able identify depression anxiety outside voice wa able shut realized letting voice control point wa avoiding thing loved depression anxiety told social outgoing feel like go natural instinct right every time successfully talk stranger prove voice wrong actually feel lot better know anyone else relate treating depression outside voice instead part personality ha really started help deal,struggled depression anxiety since high school feel like kept stuck rut long time depressed overwhelmed personality thought symptom depression sluggish unmotivated antisocial flat mood overeating comfort actually part personality know lightbulb moment yesterday wa able identify depression anxiety outside voice wa able shut realized letting voice control point wa avoiding thing loved depression anxiety told social outgoing feel like go natural instinct right every time successfully talk stranger prove voice wrong actually feel lot better know anyone else relate treating depression outside voice instead part personality ha really started help deal

"First time posting . So I dunno where to start. A little about me I’m a mixed race Syrian/ Filipino / Spaniard 32 y/o man . I am a BSN prepared nurse who worked in the emergency room during covid and burnt out hard so now I work in a surgery center . 

I have the career I busted my ass studying in all while simultaneously working a demanding sales job / taking care of my new child with my wife / maintaining a gym routine / taking care of my mom with severe dementia for the last seven years . For the three years I was in nursing school I literally had no break. No leisure time . I grinded so hard to get here . I was constantly type A ,constantly on edge .

My mom passed in January this year . And the last few years of her dementia were hard .  She lost her ability to walk, speak, eat by herself , and she became incontinent . It was awful watching her deteriorate. She herself was a nurse over 40 years . Her death while
Immensely sad was a relief to me that her suffering has ended . 

My wife and kid are great I love them both but every since nursing school and the constant state of stress I was in , I developed what I believe to be anhedonia aka not enjoying anything . My career now takes so much of my time and energy as well as taking care of my daughter that I feel I have lost my spirit , my adventurous nature (I used to skydive , outdoor rock climb and race super sport motorcycles at the race track ) and my musical side (acoustic guitar composer since 13) is almost non existent . I always told
Myself I would pick up composing again , that I would continue rock climbing and motorcycle racing , but the only thing I have time for is lifting weights which I also love but is Monotonous .

My problem is nothing gives me pleasure anymore not riding my one of two motorcycles , or driving around in my sick muscle car that I’ve always dreamed of . Picking up my guitar I can play my old compositions but have writers block and can’t make anything new. I am feeling so disillusioned by adulthood and work life and parent life balance I feel like I lost my adventurous self . I feel trapped in the monotony of married life with kids. My soul is yearning for more and I don’t even know what it is.

It was my beautiful daughters fourth birthday yesterday and we went all out for her . Yet deep down I just wanted to be alone and all the guests to leave . 

Why does nothing feel good to me anymore ? I have a life that a lot people would envy a beautiful family , all the toys I ever wanted hellcat challenger , wrangler Sahara , Ducati sport-bike , and a Harley Davidson every item
I wanted on my gear head dreams .I make tons of money and have the career in nursing I dreamed of . Yet none of this feels good . I’m constantly pessimistic inside and angry . It’s hard to soften my heart. I’m becoming increasingly introverted and I never was . I miss my adventurous spirit but now I feel trapped in Groundhog Day where I spend the day rolling my eyes and muttering cynical things under my breath . I am plagued by the worst insomnia ever too . Avg 4-5 hrs per night . One of the thing that I hate the most is that hanging out with my wife and kids can feel as a chore and not fun even tho I fake it . Like why can’t I truly enjoy these precious moments , instead I think to myself I just wanna go home . Any insight or help would be appreciated cuz I just feel like I’m on autopilot sad robot , a shell of what I used to  be, who can appreciate life’s simple moments and treasures",1,first time posting dunno start little mixed race syrian filipino spaniard 32 man bsn prepared nurse worked emergency room covid burnt hard work surgery center career busted studying simultaneously working demanding sale job taking care new child wife maintaining gym routine taking care mom severe dementia last seven year three year wa nursing school literally break leisure time grinded hard get wa constantly type constantly edge mom passed january year last year dementia hard lost ability walk speak eat became incontinent wa awful watching deteriorate wa nurse 40 year death immensely sad wa relief suffering ha ended wife kid great love every since nursing school constant state stress wa developed believe anhedonia aka enjoying anything career take much time energy well taking care daughter feel lost spirit adventurous nature used skydive outdoor rock climb race super sport motorcycle race track musical side acoustic guitar composer since 13 almost non existent always told would pick composing would continue rock climbing motorcycle racing thing time lifting weight also love monotonous problem nothing give pleasure anymore riding one two motorcycle driving around sick muscle car always dreamed picking guitar play old composition writer block make anything new feeling disillusioned adulthood work life parent life balance feel like lost adventurous self feel trapped monotony married life kid soul yearning even know wa beautiful daughter fourth birthday yesterday went yet deep wanted alone guest leave doe nothing feel good anymore life lot people would envy beautiful family toy ever wanted hellcat challenger wrangler sahara ducati sport bike harley davidson every item wanted gear head dream make ton money career nursing dreamed yet none feel good constantly pessimistic inside angry hard soften heart becoming increasingly introverted never wa miss adventurous spirit feel trapped groundhog day spend day rolling eye muttering cynical thing breath plagued worst insomnia ever avg 4 5 hr per night one thing hate hanging wife kid feel chore fun even tho fake like truly enjoy precious moment instead think wanna go home insight help would appreciated cuz feel like autopilot sad robot shell used appreciate life simple moment treasure,first time posting dunno start little mixed race syrian filipino spaniard 32 man bsn prepared nurse worked emergency room covid burnt hard work surgery center career busted studying simultaneously working demanding sale job taking care new child wife maintaining gym routine taking care mom severe dementia last seven year three year wa nursing school literally break leisure time grinded hard get wa constantly type constantly edge mom passed january year last year dementia hard lost ability walk speak eat became incontinent wa awful watching deteriorate wa nurse 40 year death immensely sad wa relief suffering ha ended wife kid great love every since nursing school constant state stress wa developed believe anhedonia aka enjoying anything career take much time energy well taking care daughter feel lost spirit adventurous nature used skydive outdoor rock climb race super sport motorcycle race track musical side acoustic guitar composer since 13 almost non existent always told would pick composing would continue rock climbing motorcycle racing thing time lifting weight also love monotonous problem nothing give pleasure anymore riding one two motorcycle driving around sick muscle car always dreamed picking guitar play old composition writer block make anything new feeling disillusioned adulthood work life parent life balance feel like lost adventurous self feel trapped monotony married life kid soul yearning even know wa beautiful daughter fourth birthday yesterday went yet deep wanted alone guest leave doe nothing feel good anymore life lot people would envy beautiful family toy ever wanted hellcat challenger wrangler sahara ducati sport bike harley davidson every item wanted gear head dream make ton money career nursing dreamed yet none feel good constantly pessimistic inside angry hard soften heart becoming increasingly introverted never wa miss adventurous spirit feel trapped groundhog day spend day rolling eye muttering cynical thing breath plagued worst insomnia ever avg 4 5 hr per night one thing hate hanging wife kid feel chore fun even tho fake like truly enjoy precious moment instead think wanna go home insight help would appreciated cuz feel like autopilot sad robot shell used appreciate life simple moment treasure
"I went to a psychiatrist and I might be bipolar. After she said it I've been looking at all my past actions and jt makes more sense. These past two years I've tried to kill myself,  seen a psychologist,  started medication and sorta accepted that I have depression and anxiety. Thats different though. Depression is the common cold. Bipolar makes you sound ""crazy"" yes the stigma is real. I've told two people in my life this. I'm starting a mood diary. I don't know if I'll ever feel normal anymore. What if my good times I'm actually manic. The lows are hard. My bed is my favorite place. I think about all the items I can use to end my life. Not to maim myself but to be successful because I would be worse if I came into a physical disability. I think it would be a great escape. The world wouldn't change or miss me, only a small number of people would be affected. I do not want to take medications, at first I was happy to hear it might be biological,  so then I couldn't help it, but that seems to me I'm stuck in it.if it was how I was raised thats better something I can overcome.  I feel weak for not being able to overcome this. To use medication as a crutch. We live in a society where we reach for meds before fixing the root of the problem. I'm worried I won't find someone to love me because of this. Because of this possible diagnosis. I know that before I was in this situation I wouldn't have considered dating someone with a mental illness. I treat people with mental illness and take of people with physical illnesses and I just never thought it would be me, like I'm too good for mental illnesses.

"Hey guys, so this may seem like a weird thing to need help with but I’m just trying to figure out if I’m actually depressed or if I’m going through something else.I’m nineteen and recently I just moved to another state for school and lately I haven’t been attending most of my classes and my grades are extremely bad right now. I just can’t seem to get myself to go. I’m just surprised because I have never done this before, it’s not like me to skip classes. Most mornings I just lay in bed until noon. I don’t know if this is extreme laziness or something else. I’m constantly in my head and I’m extremely worried about my grades but am I really that worried if I keep skipping class? I also feel like I have a lot of anxiety when I have to be around a lot of people, especially ones I don’t know. I know I’m an introverted person but being an introvert doesn’t mean that I have anxiety around a lot of people, I just prefer to be in a small group or by myself most of the time. I even get anxious when I’m just walking to class or going to the grocery store my myself. I don’t really feel happy most of the time, and I don’t think I’ve felt happy for a while. I can get temporary happiness by watching something funny or by reading a book since that’s my favorite thing to do, but right after I’m done I’m right back to where I was. I don’t understand what it is, I have loving parents and they have given me all I could hope for (they are helping me financially by helping pay for my rent and by paying for the classes I am taking right now) and yet I don’t have the decency to even repay that by going to class.

"I’m 23 years old and have been dealing with Deep depression for nearly 7 years now. Most of my depression stems from my years of being relentlessly bullied in high school. It started getting worse this past year when I started reflecting on my life and who I am. I’ve been crying myself to sleep nearly every other day this past year and it’s gotten to the point where I would just take Tylenol to ease the pounding in my head. I have a lot of troubles focusing in school and forget everything I learn within 24hours it’s just absurd now. I would learn a fairly easy concept but then forget what I learned the next day. The other day, I was on the phone with my parents telling them a funny story about what I heard in the coffee shop and they asked me when it happened and I couldn’t recall if it was yesterday or before yesterday. I then asked her how the doctors appointment went and she told me she didn’t have one that was last week. Near the beginning of my depression I did not have this problem. To add, i feel quite dumb to be frank. I just can’t understand things anymore, even short easy things I just can’t find the capacity I feel like I’m decaying.

"Fun experiment for somebody who wants to track their own journey through depression, particularly if you happen to be job hunting.

Write a resume and cover letter at the point before you start treatment.

Then, repeat the process at monthly intervals.

Finally, every three months, compare your original compositions with the ones you write when you are feeling more confident and better about yourself.

You may also find - like I did - that the process of actually learning to sell yourself and not put your self down is therapeutic. You can see, on paper, what a non-depressed person writes like. And see what a depressed person writes like. And then compare and contrast.

Once you know how a mentally healthy person expresses themselves, you can be on the lookout for signs that the way you talk about your own abilities is being compromised by your depression.

Something I've noticed about my dysthymia: it puts me at major disadvantage in the job market (I've been freelancing for a few years but am looking at 'chunkier' remote opps currently).

I tend to enormously undersell myself in job interviews and client pitches. Which has sometimes created a vicious cycle of attracting underemployment and bad clients. Hard to blame them. You attract what you put out into the world.

Anyway. Found this really helpful. I'm flabbergasted by the cover letter I just wrote and how much more assertive and confident it is than the last template I threw together a few months ago.

"A thought I had today that I thought I would share with the sub. I'm sure not groundbreaking or original. But I thought I would hem it out anyway. 

To state the obvious, the first step in getting well from depression is acknowledging that you have it and reaching out for help. If you can't get to the first of those stages (acknowledgement that you're depressed) then you can't get any further. 

The problem with depression - at least as I experienced it - is that it convinces you that it's shameful. 

Depression sounds so embarrassing. It carries so much stigma - much more so, IMO, than either ADHD or anxiety (feel free to challenge me on this point, just my perception of attitudes). 

Your depression tells you that if you admit that you're depressed - to yourself or your social network or publicly - that you're going to become a social pariah. That people are going to talk behind your back about how you've become crazy. That your existing social isolation will therefore only multiply.

As I start to feel better, I realize that this is either flat out wrong or a gross exaggeration. Coincidentally somebody told me recently that they'd been treated for depression. I didn't think any less of them. I simply felt bad for them, was glad they were getting help, and that sense of comfort that comes from knowing you're not the only one going through this. 

The rotten nature of depression is that it's like an abuser that convinces you that reporting the abuse would be harmful. Can a mental illness be said to gaslight you? If it can, then depression meets the criteria, IMO. One of the truly pernicious facets of this.",1,thought today thought would share sub sure groundbreaking original thought would hem anyway state obvious first step getting well depression acknowledging reaching help get first stage acknowledgement depressed get problem depression least experienced convinces shameful depression sound embarrassing carry much stigma much imo either adhd anxiety feel free challenge point perception attitude depression tell admit depressed social network publicly going become social pariah people going talk behind back become crazy existing social isolation therefore multiply start feel better realize either flat wrong gross exaggeration coincidentally somebody told recently treated depression think le simply felt bad wa glad getting help sense comfort come knowing one going rotten nature depression like abuser convinces reporting abuse would harmful mental illness said gaslight depression meet criterion imo one truly pernicious facet,thought today thought would share sub sure groundbreaking original thought would hem anyway state obvious first step getting well depression acknowledging reaching help get first stage acknowledgement depressed get problem depression least experienced convinces shameful depression sound embarrassing carry much stigma much imo either adhd anxiety feel free challenge point perception attitude depression tell admit depressed social network publicly going become social pariah people going talk behind back become crazy existing social isolation therefore multiply start feel better realize either flat wrong gross exaggeration coincidentally somebody told recently treated depression think le simply felt bad wa glad getting help sense comfort come knowing one going rotten nature depression like abuser convinces reporting abuse would harmful mental illness said gaslight depression meet criterion imo one truly pernicious facet

"What if we stopped taking our depression so personal. 

I was reading an article about an experiment done on mice. The details of the experiment are not important just that they were messing with the mice's serotonin to test it's social behaivor. This got me thinking. My depression and anxiety are basically just a complication of a physical component of myself, like a broken arm or diabetes. I know we've probably heard this comparison before but how far do we go with it? For me, the article helped me realize that I shouldn't think of my mental health problems as a personal defect in my personality or character. I'm simply just lacking in the right connections, chemicals and/or physical structure of my brain. 

I urge you to detach yourself from your depression. It is certainly attached to you but the fact that it can be dettached from you should let you know that it isn't an essential part of your being and you shouldn't personally identify with it. 

This reminder kind of takes the burden of depression off from me.

I use to heavily abuse pot to cope but stopped because my financial situation dictates I quit because I’m in a poverty cycle all because I started at university so late and don’t make shit. I couldn’t be any less positive and it’s not as easy as being positive one day at a time I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without knowing I tend to crash and burn relationships that mean everything to me, all because I’m on the spectrum and miss tact and empathy in what I’m saying which has left me socially alone. I feel like I truly have no one in my corner and my negative energy drives everyone away but it’s not as easy as being positive one day at a time for me because life hits like a freight train, to put it in perspective since the end of 2020 I lost my dad,girlfriend, car and 3 jobs in the matter of the first few months of this year, it was so bad I grew out my beard for months which isn’t like me to not be clean shaven. Hookups with girls got me from thinking of my gf who left me after my dad passed but the memory of those hookups have me wishing to hold on to those people one last time, im stuck living with my mom and aunt again because I moved back in right before COVID hit. I feel like when life fucks with me it literally does it all at once, I had a time like this when I was 17 where my life as I knew it crumbled before me as my family broke up I moved out hating my family, my sister constantly caused police to be coming over and during that time I had a heat stroke ( now heart complications/muscle problems), and rolled my truck after only a couple of shots. What do I need to do to put some grit back into me, I feel like I use to be so much more mentally tough but now it seems like my heart is cold and I need to stop treating myself like my own worst enemy. It’s affecting me life and those around me.

"Let me break it down. Am I wrong to feel disconnected/ not accepted by my family? Three years ago, I moved away for college (only 45mins away from hometown) and my mom basically stopped inviting me to family outings because I was always busy. Fine, whatever. A year ago, I moved back to my hometown and am living much closer to my family again. My mom continues to not invite to anything, I only go to things I'm invited to on Facebook. And, when I show up for these parties, no one talks to me first. I have tomato the first effort to talk to anyone. The only people who will come up to me first are my grandparents. Everyone else ignores me or only talks to me when my mom is around. It makes me feel like they only see me as an attachment to my mom and not an actual human with feelings because I will try to add to the conversation and will constantly just be ignored and not acknowledged at all. Something else that bothers me is that the reason I moved back from was breaking up with my partner of three years and my mom keeps mentioning them. My mom will say things about how sweet they were, how she misses them, and how she wishes I didn't ""think"" I was gay (I recently came out). I've talked to her before that I want her to stop mentioning my ex and she doesn't, to me. She will continue to talk about them to my sister and call ym sister all the time but never calls. My sister knows about everything happening in everyone's lives before I do because no one makes an effort to call me or text me.

"Hope this is withing the guidelines and acceptable:)

Is there anyone going through something similar or can relate? I'm in a marriage that I have been struggling for years and things just aren't getting better. I am 30plus with 2 children under 6 yrs old and been married/together 10ish years. If I get too emotional, I just get left alone till I calm down. Hasn't ever looked into how to help. I am not and never have been suicidal or wasn't to hurt myself or anyone. However, my depression can consume me sometimes and I have a day where I barely move, hah. I never let the kids see me like that, but it gets exhausting. I react ""emotionally"" and basically get ignored. If we fight or my spouse is mad at me and I cry, I get ignore. My spouse cries? Especially if it's cuz I'm mad, I feel like complete crap and try to fix it all day. 

I also have issues being honest with what I don't like. Like if something passed my internal boundaries, if I think saying something will upset someone I care about, I don't say anything. 
There's a lot of other stuff going on as well but these.are not mentioned.

So, is there anyone going through anything similar or can relate? Any thoughts, advise?

"I went to school to study acting and creative writing, graduating this past spring. It was a passion and what I want to do for a living. I love the arts and telling stories whether it be on paper or playing a character because it gives me a chance to not be me. 

I feel like I've wasted my life because I constantly get asked questions by family and others what my 'backup plan' is or when I'm going to have my 'big break.' It's an innocent question but it comes off as them expecting me to fail. I work at Target as a wageslave to make ends meet and come home exhausted. I feel like less of an artist every passing day. I'm only 22 and I feel like I've thrown my chance at life away by trying to be an artist. Family who have no experience working as artists just constantly berate me with questions about when and why and how and what-if and it feels like no one believes that I can actually do this. Instead of asking how it's going, I'm just challenged by everyone on the fly with questions just so they can hear me say, 'I don't know,' and feel good about themselves having caught someone wishing to keep their creative side intact off guard and question their life choices. All this coming at me makes me feel like a waste of skin, and when that happens it's kind of hard to create anything.

I've made a mistake and now I'm left wishing I simply didn't exist. Someone wishing to be an artist is now seen as immediate failure and it just leaves me feeling so helpless and drained. I've come to often think about how meaningless my life is now and simply wish to just vanish.",1,went school study acting creative writing graduating past spring wa passion want living love art telling story whether paper playing character give chance feel like wasted life constantly get asked question family others backup plan going big break innocent question come expecting fail work target wageslave make end meet come home exhausted feel like le artist every passing day 22 feel like thrown chance life away trying artist family experience working artist constantly berate question feel like one belief actually instead asking going challenged everyone fly question hear say know feel good caught someone wishing keep creative side intact guard question life choice coming make feel like waste skin happens kind hard create anything made mistake left wishing simply exist someone wishing artist seen immediate failure leaf feeling helpless drained come often think meaningless life simply wish vanish,went school study acting creative writing graduating past spring wa passion want living love art telling story whether paper playing character give chance feel like wasted life constantly get asked question family others backup plan going big break innocent question come expecting fail work target wageslave make end meet come home exhausted feel like le artist every passing day 22 feel like thrown chance life away trying artist family experience working artist constantly berate question feel like one belief actually instead asking going challenged everyone fly question hear say know feel good caught someone wishing keep creative side intact guard question life choice coming make feel like waste skin happens kind hard create anything made mistake left wishing simply exist someone wishing artist seen immediate failure leaf feeling helpless drained come often think meaningless life simply wish vanish
"So basically the last week or so I have been getting some really strange thoughts with having to do with my girlfriend or family. They play in my head over and over and don't leave so after doing a little research it seems like they are intrusive thoughts. They popped in my head out of the blue and I can't seem to rid them of my mind. It has been constant and it is starting to affect my day to day life. I have never had any bouts with depression or anxiety before so this is a foreign feeling to me and it has really freaked me out. They vary from picturing my family getting killed or my girlfriend dying and stuff similar to this. I have been sleeping fine but always seem tired. I just can't get myself to tell my girlfriend or my family what I have been thinking, thinking that I'm going crazy or something, and who knows maybe I am lol. I'm just trying to figure out what I am feeling and why I am feeling this way. If anyone has any advice or suggestions on what will help or what I should do to combat this that would be greatly appreciated!",1,basically last week getting really strange thought girlfriend family play head leave little research seems like intrusive thought popped head blue seem rid mind ha constant starting affect day day life never bout depression anxiety foreign feeling ha really freaked vary picturing family getting killed girlfriend dying stuff similar sleeping fine always seem tired get tell girlfriend family thinking thinking going crazy something know maybe lol trying figure feeling feeling way anyone ha advice suggestion help combat would greatly appreciated,basically last week getting really strange thought girlfriend family play head leave little research seems like intrusive thought popped head blue seem rid mind ha constant starting affect day day life never bout depression anxiety foreign feeling ha really freaked vary picturing family getting killed girlfriend dying stuff similar sleeping fine always seem tired get tell girlfriend family thinking thinking going crazy something know maybe lol trying figure feeling feeling way anyone ha advice suggestion help combat would greatly appreciated
"It has been a bad couple of weeks, to be honest it’s been a bad 5 years.
Ever since I reached my 20s I’ve been going through a shitstorm of well… shit.

To be honest, I feel like I no longer know who I am. It’s like I have been broken for so long, I don’t know what I want anymore, I don’t want anything, I just want my life to be over. Not in a sense of suicide, because I know I will never have the courage to do it, but in the sense of waiting for my time to end… I just sit and wait, and that’s fucking depressing. I’m tired of being powerless, weakness… being a human being is not my cup of tea, I want to be a walrus or something.

Jokes aside, I feel like I need to take action, action number 1 should be to quit smoking and drinking for a month, get my head clear and do some sports. But then I’m like what’s the point? 
Its as if I am terrified of feeling any pain from changing my life, but at the same time I’m in constant pain and sadness, numbing myself with another joint and another beer. It is very infuriating that I let myself reach this point, I’ve let myself go… and I am struggling to get up again, I can’t get up again.

"Well, I (m22) fucked up my life pretty harshly...

I feel like I have everything that many people can ask for: a relationship, friends to talk to, a caring family, plus I am studying computer science and finished my Bachelor's degree.

I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't know when it started. I only know that my life is kind of falling apart. I am losing so many things.

To do my Master's degree I applied to another university and got accepted. I am currently looking for a new place to live. My mother's side, including her, is fully against it. My father kind of supports me, but only because he has to. My girlfriend(f21) of almost 6 years also supports me, but I don't know how to deal with it.  
I've always been the peacekeeper in my family, and now I am the common enemy. My GF told me to cut them off, but I honestly don't know if I have the strength to do it, even considering the horrible childhood I had. She also subtly threatened to break up, if I did not cut them off, by the time I moved out.

I don't know. Every person around me is filled with so much hate. Everybody hates everyone, and it feels like they are all fighting, and the winner gets to isolate me from the others. I don't even have a say about it, as I am ""not mature/experienced/wise"" enough to make my own decision. I hate it. 

I don't know what I should do. I don't know where in my life I took a wrong turn, and certainly how to fix it all. I also consider therapy, after I moved out, but as there currently are not many free therapists, I also don't know when I will be able to have it.  
I feel so uncertain and abandoned, even while having so many people around me, who seem to care. I also feel so ungrateful for ""doing what I  want"". I can not even feel anything real or even cry, even if I feel like it. It all feels so fake. I feel like I don't even deserve emotions.

Why should I even keep trying?

I have all the stupid gadgets I want.... I'm fed....I sleep well...

I just don't feel connected with friends anymore.....

I wish going out and meeting people was easy for me, but it's not. 

I'm so used to being the outcast and just listening to everyone's conversation that I almost don't know what to do or say when the opportunity presents itself. 

If I see a beautiful woman, I just stop myself and think ""damn, what the fuck do I even say to her?"" Then I gotta line up at least 3 potential conversation topics in my head so I can seem interesting. By that time I just chicken out anyway.

"Since the start of the pandemic I had to relocate locations at a job that I was happy working at for the longest. Had never been depressed since always happy and what not. But the pandemic hit and I had to relocate to a workplace where. Unfortunately I was unhappy with the job location. Come about a year and I left the job location because it was really making me suffer and ruin my mental state of mind. Now that I'm not working much, I found some jobs. But wasn't as happy there. And left them after about a month and my mother belittles me for "" leaving a job, I wasn't happy at"". 

And she goes "" oh you think I like my job and am happy there "" , all sarcastically as if I don't know she's been at her position for at least 25 years. Like God damn I don't care if you're happy at the job you're working. Why do you have to belittle me and mock me for applying to jobs and not finding interest in working them. 

No job I work at as of the pandemic has been worth my happiness or mental downfall. But according to her it should be worth my mental health. And degrade it further according to her.

Now recently I went and spent some money to go see a therapist. Made some suggestions I don't disclose my personal life with someone who obviously at this point doesn't care despite me communicating it with my mother beforehand, multiple times. 

But I just don't know how long I can stand this toxicity. I do have a job lined up for the next week and It's one I applied to years ago and hoped to get in there. And I hope I do get in there as they've gone through the hiring process with me.

I won't disclose how much I make with my parents as they'll just leech my money and milk it for rent. Preventing me from moving out. My father makes 90k a year and my mother 55k a year. 

I just need to survive mentally until December. If I can't then I'll probably kill myself then. I've got a document with text I've written about my feelings and my depression. And a video I have listed to upload on YouTube the day I plan to take my life. If my parents DON'T change.

"I'm a male and I have depression and a number of other mental illnesses. I think about killing myself every day, and I think I'm a pathetic cunt, I wouldn't kill myself because it'll hurt my family and friends, but it doesn't mean i haven't tried, it feels like your in hell before you kill yourself, you get a sensory overload and you wanna escape everything. I dont want to kill myself because I'm scared of what's after death and if I don't see my friends and loved ones ever again. I cut myself with a kitchen knife every day for fucking months now, I only did it because I'm only angry and sad all the time and i think i should punish myself for being such an unhappy person who only feels these two emotions ALL THE TIME, it's also because I want to feel more. So I cut myself because of punishment and to feel something more. Now it doesn't even hurt anymore when I cut myself, even when I go in deeper it still feels like nothing. I've got used to the cutting to the point where it doesn't hurt anymore in my arms. I'm only happy with my mates really, I do like relationships with a boyfriend or girlfriend because I'm bisexual, I dont have boyfriend or girlfriend because they just leave you in the end anyway. I've only tried to kill myself twice, the last suicide attempt was only months ago by now. My depression has gave me some of the worst paranoia of my life so far, I think bad luck and trouble is coming my way all the time. I even think people ar talking about me behind there back 24/7 getting me into trouble. I'm stressed out every day and it's making me age more quickly than usual. I sometimes think and feels worms under my skin, people say there not even there. I have mental breakdowns in public and in my home nearly every day in a week, in my breakdown episode I usually cry and swear telling myself to shut up, and then I hit myself and hurt myself. The police have came to my house because of my breakdowns. I'm starting to like alcohol, I'm actually kinda addicted. Sometimes I think I should get raped tortured and killed, because I sometimes think I caused all the worlds problems. I just think deeply you see. My depression as made me go insane a bit, I was even at risk of insighosis. I cry myself to sleep rarely, I used to do it all the time but my pain is becoming normal for me.

"Hi all,
I've been actively fighting my depression for years, since I realize it was there. I've been taking Lexapro (20mg) for a couple years now. Seems to take the edge off the worst of it but like today I woke up really depressed, ie: don't want to live anymore, life feels meaningless and just endless pain and disappointment, I feel like I serve everyone around me and no one really cares about me.

I'm not suicidal...well let's be real, I am because of the depression but I've decided not to remove myself from life... That'll happen whether I like it or not and it'll always be an option but since it's so permanent I'd prefer to see if I can fix my brain and be delusionaly happy like normal people.

So what worked for people? Appreciate it before I try the permanent option.

Thanks all!",1,hi actively fighting depression year since realize wa taking lexapro 20mg couple year seems take edge worst like today woke really depressed ie want live anymore life feel meaningless endless pain disappointment feel like serve everyone around one really care suicidal well let real depression decided remove life happen whether like always option since permanent prefer see fix brain delusionaly happy like normal people worked people appreciate try permanent option thanks,hi actively fighting depression year since realize wa taking lexapro 20mg couple year seems take edge worst like today woke really depressed ie want live anymore life feel meaningless endless pain disappointment feel like serve everyone around one really care suicidal well let real depression decided remove life happen whether like always option since permanent prefer see fix brain delusionaly happy like normal people worked people appreciate try permanent option thanks

"I don't have a therapist currently. Every start of a new therapist relationship is exactly like how the title is with friendships.

My psychiatrist would say ""maybe this new therapist will help you process what happened""

And I'll respond ""Are you hearing what I'm saying? I just said I've been hurt so many times by a therapist and by close friends trying to seek support from them and am *unable* to go through this whole cycle again and you're proposing I do the exact same thing""

And it's the same with friends. People I'm very close with and mean the world to me. Friendship breakups suck just as much as romantic breakups.

I'm a very extroverted person and its easy for me to initiate and talk to people. It would be very easy for me to go on my irl social media and ask for support from people because I'm feeling very down. But I don't do it because I understand that what I really want is comfort from a few certain people I admire and like, and it coming from anyone else makes little difference. But those certain people are long gone because those are broken friendships now. I understand what I want deep down but also know it's unattainable.

Lonely people don't have the luxury to choose who can comfort them.

I look at my text message history and see the amount of times I tried texting the Crisis-Text line that claims it's a 24/7 service and all the times I reached out for help only to get automated responses up to an hour later ""You're still in line for a counselor, if you think you are having an emergency, please dial 911""

And I look at my instagram message conversations of 'friends' with various profile pictures and look at each one saying ""I don't feel comfortable asking for your support either because you'll shy away or you never respond to messages or because I tried that before and now you've already broken my trust and hurt me""

"Allow me to give some context before I jump into recent events. Last month my partner and I had rescued a bunny from the parking lot of my brothers apartment complex. When we brought them home I had called around the area my brother lived in but received no clues as to whether this poor baby was lost or dumped. After a few days we decided to keep them (at this point we did not know the sex of the bunny) and were in the process of figuring out what to do. Two weeks later the bunny was acting strange and it turned out she had babies. We didn't realize she was pregnant as we didn't know the sex. She only had three, which is an abnormal litter size for a bunny, one of which had passed that day (we weren't sure if they were stillborn or the runt of the litter). 
We did everything we could to accommodate for the babies and the mama, doing as much research as possible and doing what we could. But the statistics were negative, everything I read about small litters informed me that all babies will likely pass...and they did. Just a few days later the other two babies didn't make it. My heart was torn. I was a wreck. I immediately broke down harder and more manic for the first time in a long time. I openly blamed myself, my poor mental health, my lack of knowledge, how I could have done things differently, and how I was a monster and I didn't want to be alive anymore. I had lost it and I still feel awful for my partner for having to witness this.
It's only been a little under a week since it occurred and I find myself still blaming myself every now and again. I can't stop the endless inner dialogue of ""it's all my fault"" and ""I'm a terrible person."" 
Everyone I had turned to spoke statistics when all I wanted was sympathy and support and someone to tell me it's okay and that it sucks.

"I recently turned 19 and am in my 3rd semester of college, and for about the past year I have slowly felt less like I am living, and now I'm at a point where I truly feel worthless. 

I spend nearly all my time sitting in my room either at my laptop watching shows or playing games or doing just about anything that is counterproductive. I've gotten noticeably overweight despite the fact that I typically only eat one meal a day. 

I end up missing most of my classes because I have no drive to do anything or learn, I only really chose to go to college because its what my parents wanted and it felt like an obvious choice at the time. I failed all of my classes in 2nd semester and I'm gonna fail probably all but one this semester, and likely won't be allowed to come back.

I was never super social in high school, I stuck to my small group of friends that I'd had most of my life, but beyond that I didn't talk that much. But now that I'm in university I have 0 friends and regularly go days without speaking at all. 

The only people I still talk with are my direct family, and I have been mostly vocal with them about this stuff, and they are understanding for the most part. They keep saying I've hit a slump from the pandemic and I'll bounce out of it, but its been this way for nearly two years now.

I started some basic medication a couple weeks ago in an attempt to help me feel more focused and driven, but it hasn't done anything besides make my Tourettes more active.

More recently I've had the phrase ""I'm not living for me"" in my head, I don't have any aspirations and I'm not skilled at anything, so I truly don't feel like there are any benefits to my existence.

Is there anything I can try and do to hinder this feeling and possibly care about life again? I don't expect to be able to turn my life around in a flash, many times I've tried to be motivational to myself for a day, and it typically only lasts for that day. But I'm desperate for anything at this point.",1,recently turned 19 3rd semester college past year slowly felt le like living point truly feel worthless spend nearly time sitting room either laptop watching show playing game anything counterproductive gotten noticeably overweight despite fact typically eat one meal day end missing class drive anything learn really chose go college parent wanted felt like obvious choice time failed class 2nd semester gonna fail probably one semester likely allowed come back wa never super social high school stuck small group friend life beyond talk much university 0 friend regularly go day without speaking people still talk direct family mostly vocal stuff understanding part keep saying hit slump pandemic bounce way nearly two year started basic medication couple week ago attempt help feel focused driven done anything besides make tourette active recently phrase living head aspiration skilled anything truly feel like benefit existence anything try hinder feeling possibly care life expect able turn life around flash many time tried motivational day typically last day desperate anything point,recently turned 19 3rd semester college past year slowly felt le like living point truly feel worthless spend nearly time sitting room either laptop watching show playing game anything counterproductive gotten noticeably overweight despite fact typically eat one meal day end missing class drive anything learn really chose go college parent wanted felt like obvious choice time failed class 2nd semester gonna fail probably one semester likely allowed come back wa never super social high school stuck small group friend life beyond talk much university 0 friend regularly go day without speaking people still talk direct family mostly vocal stuff understanding part keep saying hit slump pandemic bounce way nearly two year started basic medication couple week ago attempt help feel focused driven done anything besides make tourette active recently phrase living head aspiration skilled anything truly feel like benefit existence anything try hinder feeling possibly care life expect able turn life around flash many time tried motivational day typically last day desperate anything point

"Hey everyone, I've never posted here but I hope you're all well. I really need some advice if you have any. 

I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and I've been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I can't afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments.

Anyway, I've been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dad's insurance covers the whole family (I live at home, for cultural reasons) but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. 

Today, we were discussing my sister's divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldn't get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks I'm faking it for attention because it's not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someone's life like my sister's ex ruined hers. 

I don't know, the feelings are kind of intense right now and I don't want to cry but there's a lump in my throat and I just want to sleep but I have a huge midterm tomorrow and I have to see her later and my sister is of no help

"Severe depression and anxiety can lead to nightmares where you will refuse to sleep because you don't want the nightmares or insomnia.

This was me, on both fronts back in 2019. Now my sleep isn't perfect but it's a hell of a lot better than back then when I survived on 2 hrs a night for about 3 months. Here are the things I would tell myself if I could go back 


1. Change your sleep environment.

- make it feel safe and cozy.
- have your favourite textures (so the ultra soft blanket) and smells (my partner’s aftershave for me).
- consider a glitter lamp or a humidifier - it will lightly light up your room and you can watch the shapes to feel peaceful.
- weighted blankets are worth the expense

2. Get out of your own head.

- brain dump your fears and worries before bed and if you wake up stressed out 
- listen to something soothing - insight timer is a free meditation app if you can’t justify a paid app.

3. Make a post night mare routine
- mine was to go to the toilet, get some water and breathe then put the humidifier back on with a fresh meditation.
 
 4. If you cannot sleep, resto
- if you still can't sleep, then close your eyes and rest
- give yourself permission to play an app you find relaxing it helps but put the night filter on.

"Sometimes I think I buy too much shit online; stuff that maybe I don't need.

But then I remember that I do it because it gives me something to *look forward to* when I am at my lowest. I love ""Starsky and Hutch"" and when I am sad/depressed/anxious I will search for memorabilia online, order it and remind myself ""You bought this cool thing and in a few days it will be here. Just hang on for a few more days."" I have a huge collection at this point and everything I buy I absolutely love and have always been glad I ordered.

So, I don't know if you can classify that as a coping skill, but it really helps in the moment when I feel like I can't get through the next five minutes. Even if you don't have a ton of money, if you're feeling down, maybe buy yourself a little something to look forward to.",1,sometimes think buy much shit online stuff maybe need remember give something look forward lowest love starsky hutch sad depressed anxious search memorabilia online order remind bought cool thing day hang day huge collection point everything buy absolutely love always glad ordered know classify coping skill really help moment feel like get next five minute even ton money feeling maybe buy little something look forward,sometimes think buy much shit online stuff maybe need remember give something look forward lowest love starsky hutch sad depressed anxious search memorabilia online order remind bought cool thing day hang day huge collection point everything buy absolutely love always glad ordered know classify coping skill really help moment feel like get next five minute even ton money feeling maybe buy little something look forward
"I've lost almost all my family to death. Covid, cancer, etc. And the holiday season coming up is causing my depression to spiral out of control. It was ok for a minute but now its back, worse than ever. I notice the relationship my best friend and her sister share and its great, she checks on her, they call and talk, do stuff together. And I cant help but think of my own family who I had that with, we would call each other, do stuff, etc. I just feel so alone. I tried to express this to her, that I felt alone....and by myself and her response is I need to explore life, and went back to talking about her business.

"I married my ex husband when I was 18. We had 2 kids together.  I already had 2. There was ups and downs. Good times and bad ones but something that stayed constant was he wouldn't work. I went to nursing school with the promise he would take care of the home. This didn't happen.  After 7 years of this and also quite a bit of mental abuse I divorced him. The kids started getting into trouble and were so upset.  Plus to be honest I missed him. I went back. I did this for 8 more years. Meanwhile he had developed quite the tab habit. And me overdrawn everyday day trying to feed habits and kids. I didn't leave again til it got so bad he was needing stronger and stronger things and me and the 2 girls left at home had no running water or lights. It was hard without family.  He begged and begged me to come back. Just like last time. He also played bad guy and even tried to get me fired. He died less then a year after we left. He was in a crack house. High on heroin and fentanol. His kids devastated.  So now here am i.. with all the things ppl know I went through.  And I have to be strong for the kids. But there was some good times too. Some only him and I shared. He understood me like no one else. He wasn't always a drug addict.Maybe I actually hoped subconsciously that he would get better and we could try again. After all I had never cared about anyone like I do him. All I know is I miss him so fucking much! I cry every day.  I dont wanna live without him. Everything and I mean everything makes me think of him.. and I'm so lost. I cant believe he left me. He left me here without him and it hurts so damn bad and I dont know how to make it stop. I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire. I cant say a word.. to no one. No one understands because what I went through.  And I cant tell my kids. I have to be strong for them. They hurt too. So this is how I am truly silently feeling everyday.  My world is crushed, I feel like I cant breath, cant think, much  less want to.

"I'll start with the earliest thing that's got me hiding in a bottle of alcohol. I recently got scammed and lost my Instagram profile I had since I joined the Marines and after. Close to 9 years of my life with pictures of people who aren't with us anymore. I'm not guilible they went through my friends profile saying I needed to give him my phone number so he can send me a message with a link and then copy and paste that in the Instagram chat. I didn't wanna give him my number so I used a TextNow to be safe. As soon as I replied my account logged me out and they changed the number and email to that account. Even the emails Instagram sent me didn't give me a chance to revok it. Now it's messaging my friends saying they could make $10,000.
Some of my friends that it was actually me and now don't like me anymore or respect me because of the messages. 
I've tried asking for help but Instagram is a support forum with no real answers or anyone to really talk too. I can prove it's me there's over 600 posts on that profile.

Reading this back I know it's not a big deal but in the last 6 weeks, I found out that my girlfriend cheated on me, had to kick out my house mates because they were doing heroin, had to fight a friend because he's an alcoholic and came at me. I got robbed from people I went camping with earlier this year let em crash at my house as they live in Toledo and I live in Columbus, well I woke up and my ASUS laptop was gone. My external hard drive, $400 Sony speaker, PS4, GameCube and my external charger. All gone. Close to $3000 they stole. All the while I'm missing school cause it's just 1 thing after another so I'm failing that my GI didn't pay for the last month cause I wasn't active, so I couldn't pay my credit cards off without paying the rent for this house I now live in by myself.
So losing my Instagram account was cherry on top.

I'm sorry if this gushing but damnit as I'm trying to get a response r/Instagram I was like f*ck... I'm really depressed and my clonidine isn't helping.

Thank you all.

"Ive been depressed for over 20 years now, and i had a couple suicide attempts under my belt before i was 18. Normally i can ignore the feeling or fake being happy to keep other people from prying, but lately its been getting harder if not impossible to hide. 

It started in early elementary school. I just started asking what the point was to everything, always wondering why things are the way they are. Over time; getting bullied, being left out of everything, being told to shut up and that my view wasnt important or wanted, even getting suspended for something that happened when i was home sick, added up and i just chose to stay in my head. With parents always fighting i never felt like i could go to them for help, so i never really did.

Middle school was somewhat better, but high school is where things improved...at least for about a year or two. But as time went on the feelings came back harder than ever. I started smoking and getting into drugs and booze just to numb it, and i fell deep into it. Before my senior year was done i was homeless and got arrested for dumb shit. After i got out of jail, i started to clean up, got away from the harder substances and just stuck with weed and beer.

After high school, i moved and got a job. Nothing fancy but it helped. Ive been living with the same room mate for 9 years now and i hate it, but i cant move because of debt built up after i moved in. After i moved in initially, i found out he was lying to me about needing money for bills, all so he could open up multiple lines of credit. He always asked me to do almost everything around the apartment, then he started going through medical shit, and now he gets mad at me just becuase i dont want to buy him ciggarettes (which i quit at this point btw).

Sometime after moving in with the room mate, i ended up getting into a relationship. Everything between me and her was going good. We ended up getting pregnant, i was actually happy there for about a week. The pregnancy ended up a miscarriage, and that caused everything to flood back. I started to shut down, and in my own misery i ended things with her. That was about 4-5 years ago.

Now im at the point where im thinking about suicide again. I have anxiety worse than ive ever had it, and its keeping me from interacting in person (or even online for the most part) with anyone i dont know. I hate myself for wasting my life, and i feel like i dont deserve to be happy. Especially after what ive done.

Now its to the point where ik i need help, whether it be therapy, meds, or both. I just cant pick up the phone and call. That only makes me wonder whats wrong with me because there are people i know who have shit way worse, but they can still ask for help.

The reason i went on this rant was to try to work some shit out in my head, maybe get enough out to ease the burden some....but in all honesty its not working. I just dont know anymore, about anything",1,ive depressed 20 year couple suicide attempt belt wa 18 normally ignore feeling fake happy keep people prying lately getting harder impossible hide started early elementary school started asking point wa everything always wondering thing way time getting bullied left everything told shut view wasnt important wanted even getting suspended something happened wa home sick added chose stay head parent always fighting never felt like could go help never really middle school wa somewhat better high school thing improved least year two time went feeling came back harder ever started smoking getting drug booze numb fell deep senior year wa done wa homeless got arrested dumb shit got jail started clean got away harder substance stuck weed beer high school moved got job nothing fancy helped ive living room mate 9 year hate cant move debt built moved moved initially found wa lying needing money bill could open multiple line credit always asked almost everything around apartment started going medical shit get mad becuase dont want buy ciggarettes quit point btw sometime moving room mate ended getting relationship everything wa going good ended getting pregnant wa actually happy week pregnancy ended miscarriage caused everything flood back started shut misery ended thing wa 4 5 year ago im point im thinking suicide anxiety worse ive ever keeping interacting person even online part anyone dont know hate wasting life feel like dont deserve happy especially ive done point ik need help whether therapy med cant pick phone call make wonder whats wrong people know shit way worse still ask help reason went rant wa try work shit head maybe get enough ease burden honesty working dont know anymore anything,ive depressed 20 year couple suicide attempt belt wa 18 normally ignore feeling fake happy keep people prying lately getting harder impossible hide started early elementary school started asking point wa everything always wondering thing way time getting bullied left everything told shut view wasnt important wanted even getting suspended something happened wa home sick added chose stay head parent always fighting never felt like could go help never really middle school wa somewhat better high school thing improved least year two time went feeling came back harder ever started smoking getting drug booze numb fell deep senior year wa done wa homeless got arrested dumb shit got jail started clean got away harder substance stuck weed beer high school moved got job nothing fancy helped ive living room mate 9 year hate cant move debt built moved moved initially found wa lying needing money bill could open multiple line credit always asked almost everything around apartment started going medical shit get mad becuase dont want buy ciggarettes quit point btw sometime moving room mate ended getting relationship everything wa going good ended getting pregnant wa actually happy week pregnancy ended miscarriage caused everything flood back started shut misery ended thing wa 4 5 year ago im point im thinking suicide anxiety worse ive ever keeping interacting person even online part anyone dont know hate wasting life feel like dont deserve happy especially ive done point ik need help whether therapy med cant pick phone call make wonder whats wrong people know shit way worse still ask help reason went rant wa try work shit head maybe get enough ease burden honesty working dont know anymore anything
"I hope this is the right place to post this

A friend of mine recently had an outburst and got hospitalized for nearly killing himself. I'm trying to keep in touch with him but I don't want to force him to stay on the phone which he hates.
I'm still in shock but I'm trying to keep it together and be a friend to him. I don't have anyone to talk to because he begged me not speak a word with our friends about this.
I'm so proud of him for having reached out for help and for trying so hard to get better, but it's still so difficult.
I think about him every second and I often get panick attacks thinking about so many ifs: I imagine him not improving and only getting worse there, or him feeling miserable all day in bed.
I have nightmares where he suffers so much he begs to let him die. I'm skipping school for a week because I want to figure something out before I burst into tears in front of our classmates, also I don't have any bit of energy in my body for that.
Everything might turn out fine: he might be getting the cures he needs and become ready to come back to his normal life and to face his daily challenges with new hope in his heart. But I can't stop being paranoid about the other side and I know I wouldn't be ready for that.
I just wanna be a good friend to him and let him know that I'll be by his side, but I fear this won't be enough to convince him to push through.

Any bit of advice will be appreciated.

"I’m single and live at home with my elderly father. For the longest time I was a one cat kinda gal but now I have nine. I love them, but really shouldn’t keep all of them. Thinking about giving one away causes stress. Puts a big hole in my wallet though to keep them. 
Dad doesn’t/can’t help around the house. He’s living off of social security. I’m practically the maid and I don’t do a very good job of it because of depression. (makes me feel like I’m a bad daughter) My mother passed away from cancer a few years ago. Never thought I’d be/feel so lonely. My siblings that I was closest to moved out of state. So I feel very stuck taking care of a house and my father who is slowly losing his memory. I love my father, but when do I get to have my own life? So scared I will turn into an old maid that has 20 cats for company. All is not lost. I have support from family members when I’m brave enough to ask for it. Depression sucks. Can anyone relate?

"Where do I begin?

I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June (you'll see why this is important in a second). I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, it's the most taxing job.

My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations (even though that's not why I started to do it). My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My #1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine.

I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me.

Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there won't be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesn't make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well.

I feel like I'm a waste though. Do I just ""nut up"" and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house? And even if I do that, how do I know that I will even make it to see that day given I suffer day in and day out? Or chase my dream and lose that goal of getting a house, putting financial strain on my relationship and run the risk of not getting married to the one?

I was always told to chase my dreams and stop at nothing until I am there and here I am faced with the decision and I'm ready to jump but at what cost?

&amp;#x200B;

And to some of you it may not come ass depression, but this job has taken everything from me. The happiness that my hobbies used to bring, the joy of being around my fiancé is gone, I feel absent. Almost like I'm not even here to begin with. I'm usually alright with handling my emotions, but I'm at the ledge right now ready to jump.

"I’m looking for advice to try and help my mom. She’s going through a really hard time right now and I can tell that she’s pretty depressed. 

Previously she’s been a pretty happy individual, but in the last couple of months she’s had a lot of change that she’s struggling to deal with. 

My brother, her baby, just went away to college this year and she’s really missing him. He’s about 5 hours away so she can’t make the trip to see him every couple of weeks like she did when I went away to college. But also he’s always had a special place with her, he is her baby. And he can’t come and visit much because he didn’t take a car with him so he either has to be picked up by my parents or ask a friend for a ride. 

So she was already down about him, but also her mom passed away last month. She wasn’t sick that long, and we all thought she was on the mend and she was about to be released from the hospital when her lung collapsed and less than 24 hours later she was gone. 

My mom flew to be with her but her plane arrived about an hour after my grandma passed. Needless to say, this has just added to my mom’s mental exhaustion and depression. 

I came home today and she and I arrived at the same time and she just broke down sobbing. 

This woman is the strongest woman I know. She would give the shirt off of her back for anyone but especially someone in her family if they needed it and I don’t know what I can do to help her. I am looking to move out in a few months and I’m a little afraid that it might be the straw on the camel’s back.

"I’m not 100% sure about this but I was thinking that perhaps my depression makes it hard for me to make friends and succeed socially. Why? Well look at it this way. 

Let’s say someone is interested in me, they then make an effort to talk to me but because of my depression I might act negative, talk about negative things. Not only this but sometimes I have no motivation to talk to someone because of depression. This may make the other person turned off. 

It’s like some people expect me to be happy and extroverted but what if I don’t legitimately *feel* happy? Am I supposed to force it so I can succeed socially?

I feel like since I am more privileged than billions of people in the world and since I have so many opportunities I should not be depressed. I should be happy and motivated in talking to people. What do you think? Should I keep being myself or should I try to change these behaviors?

"So

I've been dealing with this for a while.

I think the catalyst was when my grandma got sick, then died. She was like a second mother to me and was a huge influence on my musical interests, and taste. I know it may sound cliche, me being 19 and complaining about depression. I'm not even sure if it's real depression or if I'm just being subconsciously edgy. I've got autism, undiagnosed, and it makes me   not normal. My parents know I have autism, but they refused to get me tested for ""life reasons"" or some shit. They still don't understand exactly what it is so they get mad at me when I don't understand normal logic that normal people normally understand. It makes me feel shittier and shittier every time it happens. The feelings started early on, when I was around 14. My grandmother had been re-diagnosed with cancer after going into remission. Unlike the first time, this was      a lot more aggressive. Within months she was bedridden and we had to come over every single day to take care of her. I had to switch to homeschooling to help my dad take care of my grandmother because my dad only has one leg. That's another story. This went on for 3 years. Every single day we'd go at 7 AM in the morning, and usually get home at around 6-7 PM every night. It wore down on me real fast, those 3 years felt like a single month, yet they also felt like eternity. Slowly watching a strong and amazing woman degrade into a shrivelled husk of who she once was. week or so approaching her death I was having some very bad thoughts, I honestly wanted it to happen sooner than later at that point. The day it finally happened I didn't react much. Wasn't even sad. My sister had walked into my room while I was playing minecraft and told me. I just continued playing. Didn't really hit me until the funeral, but even that was short lived. For a good month or so after I just felt empty. Nothing good, nothing bad. Then the decline really began. I started feeling like I wasn't good enough, started treating myself worse and worse- not taking care of my hygeine, not cleaning my room, etc... I could lay in bed for hours and not do a single thing because getting up seemed so easy, yet so impossible. That's about where we are today. I've been having these somewhat high spots where I feel just good enough to get up and maybe get a few things done, but then I fall into these pits where I feel like i'm a worthless human being who's better off either dying, disappearing, or both. I've contemplated suicide many times, but only ever attempted it once. It was a stupid half-hearted attempt, I bought some pills from the gas station and swallowed them all before work. I just ended up nearly having a heart attack. My parents don't understand depression. My dad just keeps saying that all I need to do is believe in jesus. I lost my faith years ago because of that. My mom just stays out of the matter, because she thinks guys understand guys better so my dad should take care of it. I want to go to a local mental health clinic but my parents wont let me use the insurance, and it's a ways away so it would be hard to get there anyways. I'm afraid that this is going to get worse and that i'll end up dropping into a place I can't get out of anymore. I think it's been 6-7 years now, dealing with worsening depression. The looming stress of college, and afterwards adult life is certainly not helping the issue.

"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

posted on [r/findapath](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/) and /r/lifeadvice as well. Posting more subreddits so I can get more responses.

TLDR provided at the end.

**Here goes my background**

I am a 2020 grad with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in International Relations. I graduate in June 2020, particularly.

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, I was somewhat optimistic about my future. I was planning to visit my family in my home country, go on trips abroad, get an internship, etc. Then in March 2020, everything was shut down in my city. Then it led to like 14 months lockdown til reopening in July 2021.

I was frustrated, (and still am). My graduation convocation was cancelled, couldn't have a ""proper"" convocation ceremony (it was held online LOL they even streamed on Youtube), seemed like the job market is frozen and thus zero opportunities.

Yet I was planning to do my best for increasing my chance of getting employed by engaging in virtual activities or volunteering. Around Summer 2020, I was excited to learn that the government was launching the grant program for students and recent grads -- participate in volunteering and earn a bit of money. Experience + money, it sounds like a great opportunity right?

Then the scandal about this grant program just broke out. (For Canadian fellows, yes, I am talking about the CSSG program). The program was cancelled obviously, then there was a point where I started to give up and lose my hope for the future. I mostly spent time playing video games for the rest of 2020.

Jan 2021, starting a new year with volunteering at a new non-profit organization. I first started off as a graphic designer and administrative staff. Then I solely focus on designing only as I did not enjoy administrative tasks. Still have no idea for employment, but convinced myself that as I participate in volunteering, it somehow gives me an ""experience"".

Fast forward to July 2021, the city is finally opening up. Ironically, I really wanted to escape from isolation, but somehow I was anxious about it. At the moment I was too used to the lockdown -- so it seemed confusing that I am finally allowed to go indoor stores, dining on the patio, etc. It was also where my anxiety hit me hard realizing that I fucked up my past year.

**Here goes more about what I am doing &amp; how I feel now**

Where am I now? Well, I registered with local employment services and take some workshops, navigate job opportunities and apply (still haven't heard back from anywhere though), and still volunteering at the ngo that I mentioned above. Currently became a marketing team lead despite I think I know 0 about marketing, yet I accepted as it was the field of interest that I would like to pursue my career on.

Yet I am so frustrated that I haven't landed a job since my graduation. I am trying to calm myself down that the situation was not helpful at all, but then I think I am using the lockdown as an excuse for wasting my time. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before the COVID, and I gotta admit that this pandemic really worsened my symptoms including social anxiety. It is October 2021 but I am still scared to go outside though I am vaccinated.

As I am unemployed, I cannot afford to go to therapists. I am having self-paced online CBT sessions, though. Still cannot do basic chores like washing dishes and cleaning up my room... I am just stuck forever hiding inside my comfort zone. While going through Instagram and LinkedIn (I know this is not helpful) everyone seems so bright and happy -- including those who looked down on me during high school. I thought I was going to end up being more successful than them, but it turns out not!

**TLDR; Covid &amp; lockdown hit me hard, no motivation, just non-paid volunteering. Feeling like I am a failure and will never be able to overcome it. Worsened depression and anxiety symptoms.

"Basically, to sum it up:

&gt;moved from overseas back to the states. Month or so later move to CA with family member, because they said I could have a really good opportunity. Their job fell through, we move back to home state. Ended up moving Moved to a new place with a family member in a different city months later. Covid starts. No job. Family member says I have a few years with them and it’s okay. Fast forward to this year - they get into a relationship and now want to move in with them / kick me out. 

I have no car because their extra car went to my other family member (who already had two cars) for I don’t know why. They told me I could share their car it’s no problem, assuming in a year or so I’d be good enough to move out. 

But now I have 6 months, little work, no car, and I have to be ready to go somewhere. I’ve done about 20 or 25 applications and only three got back to me saying no. I feel like the whole reason I was able to stay with my family member was out of obligation and they were lonely. Now since they aren’t lonely, it’s now my fault for not working during Covid and being “ambition-less” - despite pouring time into now what’s a contracted job of audio engineering (audio is my passion). 

So now I have less than a year and at the moment months before I’m homeless. I’m not on my meds anymore, I was on viibryd for a while. Now I’m starting to feel like there is an easy way out of this.  I feel like my situation isn’t my fault, but to my family member they think I deserve this. 

One thing that annoys me is that we would make a deal in which I can do x and y for my family member and I would get paid weekly for it during Covid . But that always ended up falling through because they quit.  Also the fact that the premise of their thoughts was that they are lonely , won’t find anyone, so no rush. But now they found someone to settle with, and suddenly im put into this situation. 

There is a lot more, but it’s risky to say because of my family members social status.",1,basically sum gt moved overseas back state month later move ca family member said could really good opportunity job fell move back home state ended moving moved new place family member different city month later covid start job family member say year okay fast forward year get relationship want move kick car extra car went family member already two car know told could share car problem assuming year good enough move 6 month little work car ready go somewhere done 20 25 application three got back saying feel like whole reason wa able stay family member wa obligation lonely since lonely fault working covid ambition le despite pouring time contracted job audio engineering audio passion le year moment month homeless med anymore wa viibryd starting feel like easy way feel like situation fault family member think deserve one thing annoys would make deal x family member would get paid weekly covid always ended falling quit also fact premise thought wa lonely find anyone rush found someone settle suddenly im put situation lot risky say family member social status,basically sum gt moved overseas back state month later move ca family member said could really good opportunity job fell move back home state ended moving moved new place family member different city month later covid start job family member say year okay fast forward year get relationship want move kick car extra car went family member already two car know told could share car problem assuming year good enough move 6 month little work car ready go somewhere done 20 25 application three got back saying feel like whole reason wa able stay family member wa obligation lonely since lonely fault working covid ambition le despite pouring time contracted job audio engineering audio passion le year moment month homeless med anymore wa viibryd starting feel like easy way feel like situation fault family member think deserve one thing annoys would make deal x family member would get paid weekly covid always ended falling quit also fact premise thought wa lonely find anyone rush found someone settle suddenly im put situation lot risky say family member social status

"So lately I’ve been getting high and drunk, sometimes at the same time but I haven’t had a day where I’ve been sober for about two weeks already. Almost every day I’ve drank liquor to the point I’m stumbling and can’t do nothing but lay down feeling the world spinning, I get high also and both of these things have made me feel extremely peaceful, although I know it’s not good to be using these things as much as I have for the reason I’ve been using them. I feel I’m spiraling down to a place I vowed to not go. 

I just have a lot of pressure, I don’t know where to go or what to do to get my life started, I feel my mental health is so shitty that I can’t control the fear or sadness I feel, but no one listens to it, they think I can control it but they don’t know how hard I really tried for YEARS. Now I feel I can’t be sober and peaceful, I need to be high or drunk to feel okay and I know that’s not how it should be, I told myself I wouldn’t depend on those types of things but here I am.",1,lately getting high drunk sometimes time day sober two week already almost every day drank liquor point stumbling nothing lay feeling world spinning get high also thing made feel extremely peaceful although know good using thing much reason using feel spiraling place vowed go lot pressure know go get life started feel mental health shitty control fear sadness feel one listens think control know hard really tried year feel sober peaceful need high drunk feel okay know told depend type thing,lately getting high drunk sometimes time day sober two week already almost every day drank liquor point stumbling nothing lay feeling world spinning get high also thing made feel extremely peaceful although know good using thing much reason using feel spiraling place vowed go lot pressure know go get life started feel mental health shitty control fear sadness feel one listens think control know hard really tried year feel sober peaceful need high drunk feel okay know told depend type thing
"I've been feeling suicidal and really just wanting a way to escape from it all, and I've realised that pretty much everything that depresses me is caused by external factors and societal expectations. So I decided to isolate myself from that indefinitely to feel better.

Basically keeping to myself in my room, not associating with family (because they're extremely depressing) or anyone outside of family, not using any modern technology, and just doing creative hobbies and stuff, in an attempt to block out the outside world entirely. This is possible because I don't think my family would ever throw me out for not working.

I told a friend about it last week, and she was extremely upset and disappointed because I'm giving up on life and finding it so easy to give up on being her friend. So I offered to be penpals with her (but only talking about happy things) and to ask my psychologist about what she thinks.

My psychologist didn't see this as bad, she said that maybe a break away from life might actually do me some good, and the fact that I said indefinitely rather than permanently shows that I'm not imposing any restrictions on myself to make it permanent, should I find that I dislike it.

My friend said my psychologist is only saying this because I argue back (not true, I don't argue with my psychologist), and that isolation is only going to make me more depressed because I'm cutting off my friends and confining myself to my family, who are terribly depressing. And when I tried to explain my reasoning to my friend, she said ""fine, do what you think is best"" and she got upset and left.

I don't understand what's so bad about this. It might be exactly what I need, and if I don't do it, my only other option is suicide. I don't want to be forced into suicide because I lurked on the suicide bereavement sub and I saw that seeing the body traumatised people more, and I don't know how to spare my family from seeing my body. So while suicide is the best escape for me, I'd rather not traumatise other people, hence why I'm choosing to escape in another way which won't be traumatic to others because I'm still alive.

I don't see why everyone has to follow this mould of ""go out there and work and you'll suddenly be happy"". Going out there is going to increasingly stress me out, and since I don't have to do it, why not do what would genuinely make me happy?

"For some context, I’m a minor working full time at a fast food restaurant while taking college courses at my local community college. I have been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression (fairly severe social anxiety falls under the “anxiety” category as well). I have been taking medication and was seeing a therapist for a few months before missing a session and then never gaining the confidence to message them to reschedule.

Lately I have been falling apart. I was doing so well, I was doing well in school, working and earning money for school. I was sleeping well, eating well, keeping my area clean and tidy- basically everything that I physically couldn’t do a few months prior. I was feeling better, I was doing better.

Then everything went bad. I stopped seeing my therapist, my meds stopped working, and my doctor didn’t even listen when I tried to tell her. All because my mother was satisfied with the improvement she saw in me.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents. They just don’t know jack shit when it comes to mental health. 

Now my room is a mess, I have 20 missing assignments, and I’ve had multiple panic attacks while at work. Nearly all of my coworkers have seen me cry now which is absolutely humiliating just to top it off. They’re all very kind and sweet people that I know would never think less of me because of something like that, but the embarrassment is still there.",1,context minor working full time fast food restaurant taking college course local community college diagnosed anxiety depression fairly severe social anxiety fall anxiety category well taking medication wa seeing therapist month missing session never gaining confidence message reschedule lately falling apart wa well wa well school working earning money school wa sleeping well eating well keeping area clean tidy basically everything physically month prior wa feeling better wa better everything went bad stopped seeing therapist med stopped working doctor even listen tried tell mother wa satisfied improvement saw get wrong love parent know jack shit come mental health room mess 20 missing assignment multiple panic attack work nearly coworkers seen cry absolutely humiliating top kind sweet people know would never think le something like embarrassment still,context minor working full time fast food restaurant taking college course local community college diagnosed anxiety depression fairly severe social anxiety fall anxiety category well taking medication wa seeing therapist month missing session never gaining confidence message reschedule lately falling apart wa well wa well school working earning money school wa sleeping well eating well keeping area clean tidy basically everything physically month prior wa feeling better wa better everything went bad stopped seeing therapist med stopped working doctor even listen tried tell mother wa satisfied improvement saw get wrong love parent know jack shit come mental health room mess 20 missing assignment multiple panic attack work nearly coworkers seen cry absolutely humiliating top kind sweet people know would never think le something like embarrassment still

"I've been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but I've noticed that it started easing a bit around March/April (the start of winter in my country) and then worsening again in August/September (the start of summer), while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression. 


In winter, because it's cold, I spend most of the day lazing in the sun (yes, I know skin cancer, but I don't care), so about 4-5 hours of consistent sunlight at least. In summer, I stay out of the sun entirely because it's too hot and I absolutely hate the heat.

So this makes me think that something is particularly bad in summer to make me significantly more depressed than winter. Perhaps that's a vitamin D deficiency.

Has that been the case for anyone else?",1,severely depressed suicidal well year point noticed started easing bit around march april start winter country worsening august september start summer wa actually happy june july moment suicidal ideation anxiety driven depression winter cold spend day lazing sun yes know skin cancer care 4 5 hour consistent sunlight least summer stay sun entirely hot absolutely hate heat make think something particularly bad summer make significantly depressed winter perhaps vitamin deficiency ha case anyone else,severely depressed suicidal well year point noticed started easing bit around march april start winter country worsening august september start summer wa actually happy june july moment suicidal ideation anxiety driven depression winter cold spend day lazing sun yes know skin cancer care 4 5 hour consistent sunlight least summer stay sun entirely hot absolutely hate heat make think something particularly bad summer make significantly depressed winter perhaps vitamin deficiency ha case anyone else

"I feel like I’ve got a thousand different faces. I feel like I’m too many people all crammed inside the same head. I don’t even know which one is “me”, if any of them are. I feel like I don’t actually have a personality, I’m just a compilation of other people on shuffle so it looks like a person. Or at least some Frankenstein-esk approximation of one. 

To be clear, I don’t think I have DID or any kind of split personality thing going on. It’s hard to explain. I guess the best way to describe it is like Bumblebee in the Transformers movies, how his voice was just radio snippets all pieced together. He was still one entity, had one voice that was always “him”, but it wasn’t *his* voice. Ever. It was always hundreds of other people mashed together to fit the situation. That’s more what I feel like. 

I know some people think it’s all useless pseudo-science or whatever, but I’ve tried doing the MBTI test a bunch to try and get some sense of self, some idea of maybe what I’m supposed to look like. I did more than take the test, actually, I studied the hell out of it trying to learn about the cognitive functions and everything so that I actually felt confident in the result. And I think I am. Almost every time I’ve done the test, it says I’m an ENTP. I’ve studied the functions, and I feel pretty secure in saying I’d agree with that. Reading those things, maybe it didn’t pin down how I act externally, because how could it when that changes minute to minute, but it definitely seems to describe the internal workings of my brain flawlessly. I relate to it a lot.

But knowing that doesn’t really mean anything. I think, if anything, it just threw another spanner into the works, because it’s just one more “me” in my head that thinks I should act a certain way. And maybe it’s the most *me* me. Or maybe it isn’t. I have no idea how to tell. 

The problem I’m having right now is that all the “personalities” (don’t necessarily think that’s the best word for them, but I can’t think of another one) think they’re “me”. And I guess in some way they all are. But they’re also mostly wildly different from each other, so they conflict. Like I said, according to that test, I’m an ENTP, so extroverted, generally high energy, a little chaotic, funny (at least to some people), kind of eccentric, that type of person. And when I see other ENTPs in media or something, I see a lot of myself in them, enough that I almost feels like it “awakens” something in me that makes me think “that’s me, that’s how I’m supposed to act and when I do act like that, I feel like myself”. But then sometimes I just don’t have it in me to be like that. Sometimes I go almost completely silent. In that state right now. Averaging about 5 spoken words per day right now. When I do talk, it’s short, cold and dripping with venom. And I think to myself “this is me, I can’t maintain the ENTP shit, so this is what I default to, so this must be who I really am and that must be the act”. 

There’s others in there too, with their own ideas and everything, but these are probably the best examples as they’re polar opposites. But it changes everything about me. It changes how I feel like I need to dress, the words I use, how much I swear, how I structure sentences, whether I drink like a complete alcoholic or whether I’m completely sober. There’s no consistency. I don’t even know when it’s going to change or what causes it, it feels like it comes out of nowhere. Can happen in under a minute and go back within the hour sometimes. Sometimes it’ll last for months, like right now. Been practically mute since August.

I’ve gotten to the point where I actively try to fight the changes when they seem like they’re coming, which is hard since it’s hard to tell. Usually much easier to fight the impulse to go into extrovert mode though, so I tend to keep myself in silent mode. I crush the urge to talk when I arises, not that I have anyone to talk to anymore. I deleted all my social media and blocked all the numbers in my phone. No one outside of my house can contact me and I wouldn’t consider anyone a friend or anything anyway. I live with my mum and her husband but they’re both garbage people so I avoid them wherever possible. Used to live alone but I can’t hold down jobs cause of all my issues so I can’t afford to anymore.

I don’t even really care which “me” it is anymore, I just want to feel like I identify with an actual personality and be able to stick to it, to have some kind of consistency, to be at the point where two different people who met me on two different days would have wildly different descriptions of me. I want to stop having the constant feeling that I’m in conflict with myself because it’s not what the “other me” would’ve done. But I don’t know how to do that. I’ve brought it up in therapy, to multiple different therapists but I can’t get an answer on how to do that, or how to integrate the personalities or whatever the hell it is you’re supposed to do to become a whole person.",1,feel like got thousand different face feel like many people crammed inside head even know one feel like actually personality compilation people shuffle look like person least

"Hey,

How or who diagnoses depression or who can help me figure out my current situation?

Life has been pretty crazy (shit) lately and I feel completely lost with my emotions. So I think I should go talk to somebody about it but don't know who I should approach, a psychiatrist? a psychologist? ask my gp?

It's just.. I don't know how I'm feeling. I don't sleep well, I have no appetite, I'm restless, tired, confused.. it's like I feel nothing and everything at the same time.

I'm relatively young (late twenties), I'm in a long term relationship that is completely stale so to ""spice"" it up we decided to move to separate places so we could have some lone time and try to date again. So I'm currently looking for an apartment which is such a headache. I'm having a complete hip replacement surgery in less than a month, so I'm in chronic pain all the time, except when I take my prescription pain medication, which is an opioid so my current options are to be ""high"" most of the day and deal with the side-effects or be in quite severe pain. I just recently took on more responsibility in work, to be a project manager for one of our biggest projects. So there's workers who rely on me, freelancers who I have to be on top of so I wouldn't waste their time, putting together a plan and budget for the next two quarters and well.. manage the project so that everything is working and progressing. The pain medication interferes my sleep and if I don't take it then the pain will interfere with my sleep. For the past few weeks I've been sleeping less than 6 hours a day while constantly waking up during the night multiple times. I have no appetite, I try to eat but I'm just never hungry so I just force eat at least once a day... all of this combined is just.. a lot.. but it's weird, I feel substantial pressure that makes focusing on things quite difficult but at the same time I feel nothing, no anxiety, no feelings of down, no sadness. Like I feel pressure but I don't have any thoughts or emotions about it. Sorry for the rant.",1,hey diagnosis depression help figure current situation life ha pretty crazy shit lately feel completely lost emotion think go talk somebody know approach psychiatrist psychologist ask gp know feeling sleep well appetite restless tired confused like feel nothing everything time relatively young late twenty long term relationship completely stale spice decided move separate place could lone time try date currently looking apartment headache complete hip replacement surgery le month chronic pain time except take prescription pain medication opioid current option high day deal side effect quite severe pain recently took responsibility work project manager one biggest project worker rely freelancer top waste time putting together plan budget next two quarter well manage project everything working progressing pain medication interferes sleep take pain interfere sleep past week sleeping le 6 hour day constantly waking night multiple time appetite try eat never hungry force eat least day combined lot weird feel substantial pressure make focusing thing quite difficult time feel nothing anxiety feeling sadness like feel pressure thought emotion sorry rant,hey diagnosis depression help figure current situation life ha pretty crazy shit lately feel completely lost emotion think go talk somebody know approach psychiatrist psychologist ask gp know feeling sleep well appetite restless tired confused like feel nothing everything time relatively young late twenty long term relationship completely stale spice decided move separate place could lone time try date currently looking apartment headache complete hip replacement surgery le month chronic pain time except take prescription pain medication opioid current option high day deal side effect quite severe pain recently took responsibility work project manager one biggest project worker rely freelancer top waste time putting together plan budget next two quarter well manage project everything working progressing pain medication interferes sleep take pain interfere sleep past week sleeping le 6 hour day constantly waking night multiple time appetite try eat never hungry force eat least day combined lot weird feel substantial pressure make focusing thing quite difficult time feel nothing anxiety feeling sadness like feel pressure thought emotion sorry rant

"What Is Ho’oponopono?

Derived from the Huna (meaning “secret”) tradition based on ancient Hawaiian religious principles, ho’oponopono is a prayer-based healing practice from Hawaii that promotes forgiveness. This practice, loosely translated as “to make right, orderly, or correct,” focus on healing both the self and others, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. Used by shamans and other healers in ancient times, this practice was sought by individuals, families, and communities to bring peace and healing.

Through ho’oponopono, in its modern, popularized form, individuals make things right within themselves and with others by repeating the following prayer or mantra: “I’m so sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you. I love you.” Through such repetition, people learn to change their mindsets to promote healing and overall well-being by recontextualizing their memories. Practitioners of ho’oponopono believe that a person’s thoughts and memories create their reality; if one feels pain, it is caused by memory. This practice allows people to “clear away” their memories and free themselves from them.

It might seem difficult to believe that any healing can happen with a simple repetition of a mantra, or prayer. However, research has supported that prayer can be effective in bringing about improved physical and mental health.

What Are the Potential Benefits of Ho’oponopono?

As a practice, ho’oponopono helps people analyze situations construed as problematic in their lives, recognize the role they may play in conflicts, and mentally reframe those situations through the lens of agency and responsibility instead of blame. By understanding one’s role in a situation, one can increase action to promote healing and wellness.

Once individuals learn and apply the basic tenets of ho’oponopono, they may experience the following benefits:

1. Improved mental health, especially anxiety and depression.
2. Reduced stress.
3. Enhanced physical well-being.
4. Increased emotional control.
5. Better relationships.
6. More effective conflict resolution.
7. Achievement of inner peace.

" 

usually antipsychotics/with SSRI help me a lot but its just been fucked lately, i've had one of my worst relapses ever for the past 11 days

I just feel like i'm stuck in some alternate world of dissociation, i usually get a warning before this happens - an intrusive sensation comes on, and i focus on the feeling and suck it in, i than immediately surrender to this feeling and say ''yup It's happening again'' or if i try to fight away the sinking feeling, it gets deeper the discomfort and the dissociation goes into my head, than i get a weird feeling in my body, i don't know if it is in my arms or my neck muscles, but it sucks.

It's highly distressing.

I have diagnosed OCD.

Am i going crazy? part of me just wants to take the recommended dosage for schizophrenia to make sure i am not actually schizophrenic.

For 2 years my life was perfect, now it's in crisis again, My damn GP said it will take too long to see a psychiatrist or get to see one, and he wants me to wait to see if the extremely small upping of my antipsychotic dose will help, which clearly it has not, it has been 9 days and i have still had an episode every freaking night, it all dates back to that one traumatic event i had in 2016, i wish that night never happened and i would forever be a normal happy person, instead i am now a fucked up crazy person.

Apart of me wishes i had a bullet to just take the pain away of this sensation, it feels like i am talking to a bunch of ghosts on reddit when i ask this, people don't get this feeling follows me around, it is a part of me, a part of my brain that is actively seeking to hurt me and only the meds can block it",1,usually antipsychotic ssri help lot fucked lately one worst relapse ever past 11 day feel like stuck alternate world dissociation usually get warning happens intrusive sensation come focus feeling suck immediately surrender feeling say yup happening try fight away sinking feeling get deeper discomfort dissociation go head get weird feeling body know arm neck muscle suck highly distressing diagnosed ocd going crazy part want take recommended dosage schizophrenia make sure actually schizophrenic 2 year life wa perfect crisis damn gp said take long see psychiatrist get see one want wait see extremely small upping antipsychotic dose help clearly ha ha 9 day still episode every freaking night date back one traumatic event 2016 wish night never happened would forever normal happy person instead fucked crazy person apart wish bullet take pain away sensation feel like talking bunch ghost reddit ask people get feeling follows around part part brain actively seeking hurt med block,usually antipsychotic ssri help lot fucked lately one worst relapse ever past 11 day feel like stuck alternate world dissociation usually get warning happens intrusive sensation come focus feeling suck immediately surrender feeling say yup happening try fight away sinking feeling get deeper discomfort dissociation go head get weird feeling body know arm neck muscle suck highly distressing diagnosed ocd going crazy part want take recommended dosage schizophrenia make sure actually schizophrenic 2 year life wa perfect crisis damn gp said take long see psychiatrist get see one want wait see extremely small upping antipsychotic dose help clearly ha ha 9 day still episode every freaking night date back one traumatic event 2016 wish night never happened would forever normal happy person instead fucked crazy person apart wish bullet take pain away sensation feel like talking bunch ghost reddit ask people get feeling follows around part part brain actively seeking hurt med block
"I haven't posted on here in 4 years.  I was hoping I wouldn't be here again but I just want to get some stuff off my chest.   
This last year and 10 months has sucked so bad. I got away from sales jobs about 3 years ago and was In a better place in life. I started traveling for work and got in with an amazing company. Everything was going great. Covid came along. I stayed with my company until about Feb of 2020. We all got laid off thinking it was temporary. Spent the year having a decent time with the family. Things started to get tight financially. Over the past 22 months it has drained us. We have had our vehicles break. We have had illness. I had 2 major surgeries without insurance. My shoulder (rotary cuff) and knee (Meniscus and ACL). After about a year of not finding work and living off savings it just all went to shit. We have two children. Boy,13 and girl 15. We have tried to cut back on so many things to the point of everyone is miserable in our house and beg us to go do things. I can't afford anything atm. My wives small suv is up for repo and I don't want them to come get it. We have exhausted all means with deferments and holding it with a check by phone. My vehicle which is much older is in need of much repair. I haven't sit down with my wife in some time to explain this because I want them to be happy. Been trying to float by for a while. Feb of this year I got a job. The pay sucks and is absolutely destroying my body. Its gotten so bad I can barely walk when I get home after working 12-14 hours. I also have a part time job that has me on call all night and get very little sleep some days. I have family and friends that try to help us but there is only so much they can do. I'm at the end of my stick here. If I think about it, my heart honestly hurts and I have a massive pit in my stomach. My wife noticed in some photos of us recently at little events with the kids or w/e it may be that I look terrible. I'm not my happy self and don't have much to say anymore. I want to give them the world and refuse to see them unhappy. I sacrificed so much that my wife was looking at my clothes and they are in shambles. I have one pair of shoes, my work boots are falling apart but I tell her not to worry. I still don't have insurance and my stupid self signed a financial contract (idk if thats the right term) for the kids to have braces. (also they are my step kids, I should have mentioned that before). Their actual father refuses to help us. He will buy racecars and new trucks. He will not help us with clothes or food. He makes great money but due to covid they take forever to review his child support. He is paying the bare minimum from when he was unemployed 2 years ago. I'm so tired physically. I don't want to go to work. I try to be mister tough guy and keep going. If I lose her car I will not be able to get it back for a long time. I can barely afford food and other necessities with everything going up in price so much. Gas is absolutely killing me. I raised our credit score before all of this and was looking at buying a house. Now my credit looks like shit because I have to pick and choose what to pay every week. I sold many of my things I worked so hard for just to pay things. I bought the children a go cart and cried after I sold it. I was so dissapointed and they didn't understand what I was doing. I've sold my xbox, all my collection of old coins, tools, tvs. I even sold my steam account with my games on it which crushed me.  I even sold my hunting rifle which is a huge passion of mine. I know I can buy theses things back one day but fuck me. I'm so broken and have no one to explain this too. All my friends are so caught up in there own lives I don't want to burden them with it. I've lost weight due to all this stress and scared I'm just gonna stroke the fuck out one morning.

"God bless you for even stopping to click on this. Need some support and kind words desperately , I have nowhere to turn to right now, and If you’ve read my posts before, this is a recap with multiple updates. 


Baby is 16 months, and we still have not recovered our finances...right when I was about 3 months pregnant we lost everything , all our savings due to financial emergency after emergency....



I’m 28,When we planned our baby, we were going to do engagement right around the same 3 month mark , and now as we speak I’m dealing with a flooded house! Like I’m starting to feel this will never work out for us. It’s like in one fell swoop I lost my maternity joy, engagement joy, wedding joy, some of the most important milestones that we remember forever. And I haven’t been able to focus on getting my body back in shape due to all the stress. So I never binded my hips or my waist, nor did I get to work out regularly ..
Instead of my lovely perfect hourglass figure I’m now borderline apple shape. I cry every time I look in the mirror, I hide from my partner and rarely see my friends . I used to light up a room now I hide in the back.

I was even attacked by someone at 5 months pregnant, almost losing the baby, and spending the last year and change in court trying to get justice !. It made me give birth 6 weeks early too; it was horrible.

not to mention I was 2500 miles from my family in the Bay Area for 8 whole months, I just came back to Miami area , so this whole time it was just me and my man 100% of the time with the baby, no time for ourselves.

.We make good money but it’s always gone because something is always going wrong....
Right before the shutdown we were making headway to rebuilding ourselves...then the shutdown happened and we are still struggling. My partner had a successful event planning business and he lost thousands on thousands in deposits due to the shutdown .

And we have always spent below our means, used budgets etc.

I love my partner and baby. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful. But I really feel so ashamed deep down for how everything turned out. Just need some support ...cuz most people assume when everything goes wrong that you didn’t save or plan properly..especially in communities of color.. And we did all of those things, I promise you... but life had other plans. And having to celebrate my friends and family as they get to enjoy these things has been hell for me, but I still just try to forget about my own situation cuz it’s not like they made this happen to me. And I’ve even had a couple people I trusted make fun of my situation and abandon me, so that was also painful. This journey has been crazy. It really has.


I took a job for $19 an hour and got fired cuz I got into a car accident where I could’ve died the week AFTER my dad got his prostate cancer removed. My partner and i are down to one income , i was supposed to be using the money from this job to rebuild my business that failed during pandemic…

it’s been a month of searching for s new job and nothing is working. I have $200 to my name .I think I am going to end my life today. I have considered Baker Acting/5150 myself but I know I can’t handle being locked up with no ability to exit the facility . I gave birth during Covid so I have some bad anxiety about being back in a hospital locked up for 3 whole days cuz it was soooooooooo miserable. 

I am also currently in therapy but it’s not helping.

"Hi, 

In advance! I’m not the best out there on explaining my feelings since that’s very far away from my culture, but I’ll try because I don’t know what else to do. 

I’m 26 and not too long ago I changed my career path to something which I’ve always wanted to do. Prior to this, which was about a year and a half ago I felt as though I’ve been in an emotional hole I couldn’t get out of. My new job distracted me for a long while, I was even being complimented on how I suddenly seemed like “myself” again up until about 6 months ago, when I just fell back in to my own bullshit of complete and utter numbness.

The issue is, that normally lasts a few weeks for me but it’s been 6 months (or longer) now and I can’t seem to shake it. I don’t want to speak to anybody, I love my family and friends but I can’t seem to…make the effort I guess? This resulted in me losing important connections and even severing them because I can’t for the life of me understand what the point of them is when I can’t be a good person to them. Then I have the audacity to feel loneliness and feel even more sorry for myself 😂 When I do talk to the people I have left I can’t focus on the conversation and I just drift off in to absolutely nothing, so it never lasts long. 

My question is to those who have managed to get through this without medication (I can’t have medication due to the nature of my job) How did you manage to do it? Am I missing something? I will do everything I possibly can to help myself but I’ve tried so much. I got back in the gym, I’m eating well, I’ve meditated, I’ve gone for walks, I’ve listened to music to self medicate, I’ve slept decent amounts. I can’t seem to enjoy doing anything anymore and my passion for life has been put out like someone suddenly pissed on a bonfire. I feel like I get closer and closer to giving up everyday and I’m just too close to it this time to the point I’m starting to scare myself every now and again with the thoughts that come in to my mind. 

Any suggestions would help so much.",1,hi advance best explaining feeling since far away culture try know else 26 long ago changed career path something always wanted prior wa year half ago felt though emotional hole get new job distracted long wa even complimented suddenly seemed like 6 month ago fell back bullshit complete utter numbness issue normally last week 6 month longer seem shake want speak anybody love family friend seem make effort guess resulted losing important connection even severing life understand point good person audacity feel loneliness feel even sorry talk people left focus conversation drift absolutely nothing never last long question managed get without medication medication due nature job manage missing something everything possibly help tried much got back gym eating well meditated gone walk listened music self medicate slept decent amount seem enjoy anything anymore passion life ha put like someone suddenly pissed bonfire feel like get closer closer giving everyday close time point starting scare every thought come mind suggestion would help much,hi advance best explaining feeling since far away culture try know else 26 long ago changed career path something always wanted prior wa year half ago felt though emotional hole get new job distracted long wa even complimented suddenly seemed like 6 month ago fell back bullshit complete utter numbness issue normally last week 6 month longer seem shake want speak anybody love family friend seem make effort guess resulted losing important connection even severing life understand point good person audacity feel loneliness feel even sorry talk people left focus conversation drift absolutely nothing never last long question managed get without medication medication due nature job manage missing something everything possibly help tried much got back gym eating well meditated gone walk listened music self medicate slept decent amount seem enjoy anything anymore passion life ha put like someone suddenly pissed bonfire feel like get closer closer giving everyday close time point starting scare every thought come mind suggestion would help much

"How do I go about getting help? My parents are very old school, they don't believe in mental health at all and if I go to a psychologist I'll have to go in secret. I'm not even sure if our insurance covers mental health visits. If it doesn't I can't afford it, I have no money of my own.

According to my parents this sadness is ""punishment"" for my past sins, if I didn't do so many bad things I wouldn't be feeling this way now.

3 years ago I begged my parents to take me to a psychologist and my parents were shocked and said ""our daughter is not crazy"" and shut down the topic as quickly as they could. Like end of discussion. 

This lead to my attempted suicide and even that they covered up, said to the emergency doctors that what happened just happened by ""accident"".

I've been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder for 6 going on 7 years. Currently I'm on 60mg nuzak to treat my depression. I've been feeling like it doesn't work anymore. I've said this to my psychiatrist, and ive tried to make appointments time and time again. She just doesn't get back to me. When I do have an appointment she's about 30 minutes late for a 30 minute appointment. I'm just feeling incredibly frustrated with this. I get that she's busy and that life happens but its impossible to reach her. 

Im going to a new psychiatrist at the end of the month. Should I share these experiences? Should I share that I think my dosage is a bit high for not working well? I'm nervous about this. I just don't want to feel dismissed again. 

I feel a little defeated. Like I do a lot to manage my mental well-being but its like the therapies and meds just never help. I don't know how many more times I need to tell someone I'm sad in a therapy session. 

Please be gentle.

"My reading speed is very poor and has ruined my life so much that I believe that suicide is the only way to avoid this fact. I can't read anything normally - books, articles, signs - so it's not just because I have a reduced ability to focus due to the use of electronic devices. The thing is, it wasn't always like this. Only 7 months ago I was still reading at a normal pace. And before you ask, no, nothing traumatic or sad happened during those 7 months. 
I also have mild astigmatism, so mild that it is considered physiological. I don't think that's to blame, either. I have reading glasses that don't work, so I just don't use them. 
I have gone to several doctors and none of them have helped. The neurologist just prescribed me an anti-anxiety medication, and the eye doctor, as I said, just prescribed me reading glasses and sent me on my way. My mom doesn't want me to see a psychiatrist because she's afraid I'll be diagnosed with something ""bad."" It should be mentioned that I used to struggle with anorexia nervosa, but now - not too much. However, my mother believes that this is the cause of my reading problems, and it drives me mad.

"It’s been nearly four months since my dog passed.   And I’ve had maybe a handful of good days.   

I can’t even make a ham sandwich without getting upset sometimes.  I’ve been up since midnight and I can’t get back to sleep. 

My sleep patterns are all over the place.   Setting a set time for sleep just adds to my stress.  And the. My anxiety goes all haywire.   

I did start one of my hobbies back up, but I noticed I can easily get lost in it and blow time I need to do chores or run errands.  And while it’s good distraction , it hasn’t gotten its joy back yet.  

Just finding a new routine without my caregiving duties, and especially without my/my Mom’s dog has just been hell.  

Nothing feels as good; and any step I take is without them.   I literally got a slight raise at work, and the first person I wanted to tell, I couldn’t because she’s gone.   It’s like I can’t even be happy with anything because I don’t have anyone to share it with who cares.   Even when my dog was here, I still felt pride that I was doing good for her and making her life a little better.  

I don’t know.   Life just isn’t as fun without them.    And while I don’t feel suicidal, every thing just feels like motions and so dull.

"Hi,

I'll try to explain my situation as best as I can and I will highly appreciate if you can read it completely. In any case, I'll try to summarize everything in a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an international student who is stuck overseas in my home country (India) due to COVID from the last one and half year. I am studying in a good university on a student loan which is huge. I come from a lower-middle class family and my parents can't even speak English. My parents have very conservative Indian mentality and it is impossible for them to understand my situation.

Just after my high school, I was selected into very prestigious engineering colleges in India called IIT. I studied there for an year and got super depressed as I came to understand how the real life is. I decided to take a transfer to a very good university in Australia. I thought it would make me feel better but it did come with a hefty student loan. I was a kid I guess, I don't think there is anything that can make me feel better.

I am currently in my last year and working towards writing my honours thesis. I have been pretty stressed about general life and how exactly I will repay my loan and live a normal life. I have tried applying to a lot of internships but I got more than 50 rejections already and I have no more motivation to apply anywhere now. I don't feel anything at all. The only reason why I study or do any work is to get high marks. That's it. Very recently (last month or two), I have been even slacking off in the study part. I have also started smoking cigarettes and doing marijuana edibles every other day.

Every day, I wake up at 10 already tired and swearing about everything (in my mind, I live at my parent's home rn). I attend a few zoom group project meetings, staying silent mostly and trying to look like I did the minimal amount of work to not get thrown out of the group. Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that it's already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two (my friend doesn't smoke). While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible (legal), eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents won't know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 2-3 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on.

I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I haven't even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I can't because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe I'll start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and I'll at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday (rn it's Saturday night) which will be of around 15 pages and I haven't even started yet. I don't think I can do it and I don't think I deserve all this.

Oh also, if you haven't guessed it yet, no I have no friends. The friend I go out every evening is a very old friend who is probably the only person I talk to. He is a good person, I have tried telling him my situation but I don't think he understands it and I don't blame him. He has a completely different life and we are two different people.

I also have suicidal thoughts but the only reason I avoid thinking about it in detail is that if I die, my student loan will fall on my parents and that is just awful of me to that to them. I feel my existence is totally useless and I will bring nothing but misery to this universe. I don't think there is any point in living. I won't even get a job overseas. I will probably just get a mediocre job in India which will pay me average salary through which I will never be able to pay my loan. Probably will die with a debt on my head.

Old classmates from the college I left (IIT) have amazing jobs and I see most of them travelling and enjoying their life in beaches and clubs and whatnot. I know I shouldn't compare but in reality, I do. I just feel that I was that dumb guy who left such a college to get into this huge pile of shit. I wasn't happy there but am I happy now? Life is just a grind and the sooner I understand it, the better it will be for me. I don't have any hobbies except watching Youtube and masturbating and doing drugs.

Anything I can do? Is it possible for me to get out of the hole I dug myself for? Is there any hope for me? Is there anyone who can relate to my situation because I don't know anybody who can?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: An international student in an Australian uni studying online from my home country (India) from last one and half years. Living with my parents, smoking and doing marijuana edibles (legal) regularly. In my last year doing bachelor's honours thesis and continuously slacking in everything. No success in internship/job applications and feeling extremely stressed about repaying the loan (to the point of suicide). No social life and my family is too conservative to understand a single line of this post. Looking for some direction, someone who can relate to anything in this post or just in general help.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously a throwaway account, I doubt that anyone can identify me but if you do pls don't text me about it, it's just gonna make me feel worse. Also, I forgot to mention, Coming from a conservative lower-middle class family in India, I can't afford actual therapy plus considering my conservative environment, I can't really talk about this

"Hi guys,

So:

I've been struggling with depression for a long time. I'm waiting to see my psychiatrist in a few days so that I can begin the next thing that might help (well nothing too exciting, just another SSRI. I tried Wellbutrin and it didn't agree with me). 

I'm thinking about bringing my wife to this appointment for the first time as my psychiatrist has a bit of a habit of steamrolling me (he's a good psychiatrist, but he tends to think he knows better than other doctors too, which is a problem as I'm trying to treat an unrelated condition and it involves a psychiatric med too). And I know that if I have her in my corner I'll feel a bit stronger. 

The one thing I really want to get across in this appointment is how bad my depression gets at times. I have a habit of downplaying the severity of just about everything, and I think I've been struggling to communicate that so far.

Thankfully, I've never been actively suicidal. Deep down, I really want to live. However, I do frequently have thoughts that life is simply too difficult to bother going on with. Things are never going to get better. What's the point. It would be great if I never woke up. Etc, etc. This has been going on for as long as I've had depression (at least ten years). It has never thankfully escalated beyond that but ... I've learned to recognize it as my wake-up call that I need more help. 

I've tried to hint that I get these thoughts to my wife, and can tell that that was quite upsetting for her. I also don't want to find myself placed in some kind of involuntarily hold, although I understand that that's not as much of a concern as I thought it was. I hope it will just be interpreted as a sign that I need more help and sooner rather than later.

Does anybody have nay tips for how to broach this subject with loved ones? I worry that my wife will take it as a personal insult (""I'm not enough"") when really anyone who has depression knows that it's just part of the illness.",1,hi guy struggling depression long time waiting see psychiatrist day begin next thing might help well nothing exciting another ssri tried wellbutrin agree thinking bringing wife appointment first time psychiatrist ha bit habit steamrolling good psychiatrist tends think know better doctor problem trying treat unrelated condition involves psychiatric med know corner feel bit stronger one thing really want get across appointment bad depression get time habit downplaying severity everything think struggling communicate far thankfully never actively suicidal deep really want live however frequently thought life simply difficult bother going thing never going get better point would great never woke etc etc ha going long depression least ten year ha never thankfully escalated beyond learned recognize wake call need help tried hint get thought wife tell wa quite upsetting also want find placed kind involuntarily hold although understand much concern thought wa hope interpreted sign need help sooner rather later doe anybody nay tip broach subject loved one worry wife take personal insult enough really anyone ha depression know part illness,hi guy struggling depression long time waiting see psychiatrist day begin next thing might help well nothing exciting another ssri tried wellbutrin agree thinking bringing wife appointment first time psychiatrist ha bit habit steamrolling good psychiatrist tends think know better doctor problem trying treat unrelated condition involves psychiatric med know corner feel bit stronger one thing really want get across appointment bad depression get time habit downplaying severity everything think struggling communicate far thankfully never actively suicidal deep really want live however frequently thought life simply difficult bother going thing never going get better point would great never woke etc etc ha going long depression least ten year ha never thankfully escalated beyond learned recognize wake call need help tried hint get thought wife tell wa quite upsetting also want find placed kind involuntarily hold although understand much concern thought wa hope interpreted sign need help sooner rather later doe anybody nay tip broach subject loved one worry wife take personal insult enough really anyone ha depression know part illness
"I am considering changing my medication so I can get more done, and so everything won't feel like a chore. Right now I am on lexapro for anxiety and depression, abilify for paranoia, and wellbutrin for depression.

Right now, my life is in a loop. For five or so days, I am doing good and getting all that I want to get done accomplished, and for the next five days, I am barely scraping by. I am tired of this, especially since I used to be this super productive student in the past. Hence, my desire to change my medication.

I am jumping right to the medication because I already journal, have a therapist and psychiatrist, I meditate sometimes, I take vitamins and try to exercise when I have the energy. I also am constantly trying to adjust my mindset to make things easier for myself. Nothing is working, and I am still stuck in this loop.

I plan to ask my psychiatrist this Monday to change my medication, but I really would hate to go through the process of finding the right antidepressant, which can take forever and be full of ups and downs. I am in school right now, so I can't really afford to do that. But this option is definitely on the table, since nothing else is getting results.

What I am saying is, if there is a more holistic method that I could try right now, I am all ears. But if there isn't and I just have to try a different medication, I can except that as well. 

All help is appreciated.",1,considering changing medication get done everything feel like chore right lexapro anxiety depression abilify paranoia wellbutrin depression right life loop five day good getting want get done accomplished next five day barely scraping tired especially since used super productive student past hence desire change medication jumping right medication already journal therapist psychiatrist meditate sometimes take vitamin try exercise energy also constantly trying adjust mindset make thing easier nothing working still stuck loop plan ask psychiatrist monday change medication really would hate go process finding right antidepressant take forever full ups school right really afford option definitely table since nothing else getting result saying holistic method could try right ear try different medication except well help appreciated,considering changing medication get done everything feel like chore right lexapro anxiety depression abilify paranoia wellbutrin depression right life loop five day good getting want get done accomplished next five day barely scraping tired especially since used super productive student past hence desire change medication jumping right medication already journal therapist psychiatrist meditate sometimes take vitamin try exercise energy also constantly trying adjust mindset make thing easier nothing working still stuck loop plan ask psychiatrist monday change medication really would hate go process finding right antidepressant take forever full ups school right really afford option definitely table since nothing else getting result saying holistic method could try right ear try different medication except well help appreciated

"Basic hygiene? Hard. School work? Hard. Doing things I am supposedly passionate about? Hard. 

And it didn't always used to be like this. I used to be a straight A student, hygienic, and whatever I was passionate about at the time, I did with a fervor. 

Now, everything is hard for me to do and I am not as consistent. I still manage to get my work done for school, but it's really a struggle. I am just beyond frustrated. I don't want to be on anymore medication (I am already on lexapro, abilify and wellbutrin), but there has to be a better way. I also journal, have a therapist and psychiatrist, take vitamins, try to exercise, and just try to push myself. 

The worst part for me is that my mom and psychiatrist think I am just being hard on myself but I DON'T WANT TO LIVE LIKE THIS. Do they think I just want to half-ass my way through life forever? I want. To. Be. Great. Not just good, or okay. On top of that, I don't know how long it is going to take for me to find the antidepressant that works for me. So that would be MORE wasted time.

" I'm 15, and I constantly dread the idea of growing up and leaving youth. I really don't want to grow up, I don't want to be an adult; it seems so lonely and lifeless. And it sucks because I'm wasting every moment of my youth; it takes me so much effort to do the most basic tasks so I end up wasting the days, and I feel so lonely and I can't socialise. I don't even do much of the things I love doing anymore. I should note though, I don't think, if I have it, it's severe or anything; I don't have any specific symptoms or anything, but I regularly think about it. I feel depressed and lifeless thinking about it, I sometimes feel like cutting myself because of how much it troubles me. I'm just curious to know if I have it.

Pain seems to just be a part of my every day life… depression has become like the ungodly passenger in this vehicle I call my body. Depression just start as a passenger he stays that way for a while and during that time you think to yourself ahh depression isn’t as bad as people make it out to be and you learn to just kind of shrug it off and try to keep busy and ignore it but see that’s where we all fuck up. As soon as you let your guard down and expose that weakness depression is no longer a silent passenger just along for the ride. Depression is now a hostile car Jacker that you have allowed for come along for a ride in your vehicle and they are jerking at the wheel and and fighting for control and every now and again they get control of our vehicle and the first few time we fight like hell to get control back but you see depression is no ordinary car jacker it’s the meanest nastiest most brutal crimson there is might as well be a 6’8 Giant that has been using steroids and lifting weights since it was 5 it is an absolute power house that is very sadistic. Because you’ll get control back here and there and every time you think this is it I got the wheel back I’m driving again but what we fail to see is that we are so fucking tired from fighting that battle that we need to pull over and beg someone for help … we need a doctor to help we need to reach out but we don’t we pretend to be ok and keep driving but we fail to see how tired we are so as soon as depression reaches back over to grab the wheel we don’t have the energy to even try and fight it we just give up and crawl to the back and just hide and cry alone while from the outside people think it’s still you but little do they know this monster has taken over and is at the wheel and we are to afraid to peek our head up and flag someone down out the window because we are afraid to tell anyone we are weak and then admit that we let this happen to our selves so we sit and wait for it to just get tired and give us control for a little while and by the time we get to come back to the wheel we have forgotten how to drive and the sun is hurting our eyes and we just keep doing it over and over and we expect it to change but it won’t… I will be like this until I die or until I run this vehicle off a cliff ….,1,pain seems part every day life depression ha become like ungodly passenger vehicle call body depression start passenger stay way time think ahh depression bad people make learn kind shrug try keep busy ignore see fuck soon let guard expose weakness depression longer silent passenger along ride depression hostile car jacker allowed come along ride vehicle jerking wheel fighting control every get control vehicle first time fight like hell get control back see depression ordinary car jacker meanest nastiest brutal crimson might well 6 8 giant ha using steroid lifting weight since wa 5 absolute power house sadistic get control back every time think got wheel back driving fail see fucking tired fighting battle need pull beg someone help need doctor help need reach pretend ok keep driving fail see tired soon depression reach back grab wheel energy even try fight give crawl back hide cry alone outside people think still little know monster ha taken wheel afraid peek head flag someone window afraid tell anyone weak admit let happen self sit wait get tired give u control little time get come back wheel forgotten drive sun hurting eye keep expect change like die run vehicle cliff,pain seems part every day life depression ha become like ungodly passenger vehicle call body depression start passenger stay way time think ahh depression bad people make learn kind shrug try keep busy ignore see fuck soon let guard expose weakness depression longer silent passenger along ride depression hostile car jacker allowed come along ride vehicle jerking wheel fighting control every get control vehicle first time fight like hell get control back see depression ordinary car jacker meanest nastiest brutal crimson might well 6 8 giant ha using steroid lifting weight since wa 5 absolute power house sadistic get control back every time think got wheel back driving fail see fucking tired fighting battle need pull beg someone help need doctor help need reach pretend ok keep driving fail see tired soon depression reach back grab wheel energy even try fight give crawl back hide cry alone outside people think still little know monster ha taken wheel afraid peek head flag someone window afraid tell anyone weak admit let happen self sit wait get tired give u control little time get come back wheel forgotten drive sun hurting eye keep expect change like die run vehicle cliff

Hi, 

So my (F25) boyfriend (M23) broke up with me twice within a span of a week. He was diagnosed to depression and anxiety when he was twelve, and also has adhd. Started taking SSRIs when he was in college but recently decided to stop taking them.

 We were in long distance relationship, 3.5 hours away from each other. He called me one Wednesday and told me that we need to break up because he can’t stand long distance even though he still has feelings for but he needs to protect his mental health. Even though I was supposed to move to his city in a year and come see his almost every weekend, and spend summer there as well. I was crushed cause it came out of nowhere for me, and nobody has ever hurt me so much. Like we planned things that Monday and Tuesday. I went to his city on Friday to talk in person, and tell him that it’s a fear based reaction and maybe we should not rush decisions because he’s not in the best place mentally but I’m always here for him and want to support him because I care about him so so much, and he just can’t push me away like this. He cried and told me that he missed me and he’s just a really confused person now but he’s willing to try things. We spent weekend together and planned things again. I left his city on Sunday and he was like thank you for not letting me do a dumb decision. We talked 4 hours over the phone on Monday, but on Wednesday he called me again (kind of ironice that it happened at the same time just in a week), and told me that this is not working for him AGAIN. I’ve been in such emotional rollercoaster, and the way he went about breakup was completely dismissive, something that doesn’t sound like him. I’ve been really trying to reconcile how a person who cared about me so much (and I don’t think he faked it) is able to hurt me twice, knowing how crushed I was and that I’m always there to support him and accommodate his needs. We decided not to talk to each other for a bit. 

Im just wondering if it’s the side effects of his ssris withdrawal or he just doesn’t like me enough to fight for what we have.Despite that he hurt me so much (which makes me feel like I’m just disposable and he has not prioritized my mental health in any way), I still care deeply about him. He also told me that he has not spiraled this bad in terms of his mental health in years. And he only seems to have 2 friends in his city, and one of them is a complete self-absorbed prick, which I don’t even know why he’s friend with. What would you do in this situation?",1,hi f25 boyfriend m23 broke twice within span week wa diagnosed depression anxiety wa twelve also ha adhd started taking ssri wa college recently decided stop taking long distance relationship 3 5 hour away called one wednesday told need break stand long distance even though still ha feeling need protect mental health even though wa supposed move city year come see almost every weekend spend summer well wa crushed cause came nowhere nobody ha ever hurt much like planned thing monday tuesday went city friday talk person tell fear based reaction maybe rush decision best place mentally always want support care much push away like cried told missed really confused person willing try thing spent weekend together planned thing left city sunday wa like thank letting dumb decision talked 4 hour phone monday wednesday called kind ironice happened time week told working emotional rollercoaster way went breakup wa completely dismissive something sound like really trying reconcile person cared much think faked able hurt twice knowing crushed wa always support accommodate need decided talk bit im wondering side effect ssri withdrawal like enough fight despite hurt much make feel like disposable ha prioritized mental health way still care deeply also told ha spiraled bad term mental health year seems 2 friend city one complete self absorbed prick even know friend would situation,hi f25 boyfriend m23 broke twice within span week wa diagnosed depression anxiety wa twelve also ha adhd started taking ssri wa college recently decided stop taking long distance relationship 3 5 hour away called one wednesday told need break stand long distance even though still ha feeling need protect mental health even though wa supposed move city year come see almost every weekend spend summer well wa crushed cause came nowhere nobody ha ever hurt much like planned thing monday tuesday went city friday talk person tell fear based reaction maybe rush decision best place mentally always want support care much push away like cried told missed really confused person willing try thing spent weekend together planned thing left city sunday wa like thank letting dumb decision talked 4 hour phone monday wednesday called kind ironice happened time week told working emotional rollercoaster way went breakup wa completely dismissive something sound like really trying reconcile person cared much think faked able hurt twice knowing crushed wa always support accommodate need decided talk bit im wondering side effect ssri withdrawal like enough fight despite hurt much make feel like disposable ha prioritized mental health way still care deeply also told ha spiraled bad term mental health year seems 2 friend city one complete self absorbed prick even know friend would situation

"My life is not utter shit when I probably think of someone else’s. I am probably a very lucky person which is why I think it’s stupid I have depression and can’t get better. 

I don’t know where to start. But basically I always knew my purpose in this world which is to tell stories. Since I was 12 years old. I did everything for that to happen, studies abroad, took classes etc. Everything in life was aligning for me to do that. Then it kinda stopped. 

I used to think I only had to work hard and things would naturally come or would have a chance but it’s been years and now, I am 26, I work in cafes and I haven’t been able to break in in the industry. I couldn’t before because I moved to another country and there was immigration issues and my visa didn’t allow me to work in something I wanted. Then I got stuck in a day job for years so I could get a new visa. 

Then the pandemic happened. I got stuck in this country with no friends (all my friends moved out years ago, I was supposed to move out from this city too but I couldn’t because of the visa). I have no friends around me. I live alone and the pandemic I think made me forget how to interact with people. I got a new job after covid (worked remotely) and I am so fucking awkward I feel bad for my coworkers. They gave up trying to make conversation with me. I am also very stupid at my simple job, a cafe. 

I have no one to hang out in real life, I have no one to talk to that isn’t tired of me not feeling happiness. I have a therapist that doesn’t believe I have depression but I can’t get a new one bc it’s too expensive. My parents only tell me I ruined my life taking these decisions and they blame each other for how I ended up. My brothers tell me how secretly my parents say they were wrong about me, I had so much potential but i got lost or whatever.

I used to not feel like this, it started this year with all these comments from my family. But because it’s been forever since I did something that made me proud I realized that maybe it’s true. Maybe I fucked up so much my life I can never get my dream come true. 

When I was 18 I was in a very abusive rx that lasted three years with an older man who basically brainwashed me to believe I was mediocre and worthless and while I escaped with no help and got therapy for years, nowadays o feel maybe his words were true. Maybe I am truly “the type of person people don’t like to hang out with”. Also seeing my abuser succeeding at life and having his dream career while I just can’t get a break started make me believe there is truly no karma, no god. Why I haven’t been able to catch a break??? 

I am just tired I lowkey don’t wanna keep going. I have an online friend who tells me ending it would mean I am robbing myself of any chance but tbh I don’t think I want another type of chance. I would hate to just have a regular day job and whatever. But it seems it’s all leading to that. 

Maybe I am just being entitled af and an idiot. I am sorry if it sounds like that. I am trying to get better but it seems nothing works.",1,life utter shit probably think someone else probably lucky person think stupid depression get better know start basically always knew purpose world tell story since wa 12 year old everything happen study abroad took class etc everything life wa aligning kinda stopped used think work hard thing would naturally come would chance year 26 work cafe able break industry moved another country wa immigration issue visa allow work something wanted got stuck day job year could get new visa pandemic happened got stuck country friend friend moved year ago wa supposed move city visa friend around live alone pandemic think made forget interact people got new job covid worked remotely fucking awkward feel bad coworkers gave trying make conversation also stupid simple job cafe one hang real life one talk tired feeling happiness therapist believe depression get new one bc expensive parent tell ruined life taking decision blame ended brother tell secretly parent say wrong much potential got lost whatever used feel like started year comment family forever since something made proud realized maybe true maybe fucked much life never get dream come true wa 18 wa abusive rx lasted three year older man basically brainwashed believe wa mediocre worthless escaped help got therapy year nowadays feel maybe word true maybe truly type person people like hang also seeing abuser succeeding life dream career get break started make believe truly karma god able catch break tired lowkey wanna keep going online friend tell ending would mean robbing chance tbh think want another type chance would hate regular day job whatever seems leading maybe entitled af idiot sorry sound like trying get better seems nothing work,life utter shit probably think someone else probably lucky person think stupid depression get better know start basically always knew purpose world tell story since wa 12 year old everything happen study abroad took class etc everything life wa aligning kinda stopped used think work hard thing would naturally come would chance year 26 work cafe able break industry moved another country wa immigration issue visa allow work something wanted got stuck day job year could get new visa pandemic happened got stuck country friend friend moved year ago wa supposed move city visa friend around live alone pandemic think made forget interact people got new job covid worked remotely fucking awkward feel bad coworkers gave trying make conversation also stupid simple job cafe one hang real life one talk tired feeling happiness therapist believe depression get new one bc expensive parent tell ruined life taking decision blame ended brother tell secretly parent say wrong much potential got lost whatever used feel like started year comment family forever since something made proud realized maybe true maybe fucked much life never get dream come true wa 18 wa abusive rx lasted three year older man basically brainwashed believe wa mediocre worthless escaped help got therapy year nowadays feel maybe word true maybe truly type person people like hang also seeing abuser succeeding life dream career get break started make believe truly karma god able catch break tired lowkey wanna keep going online friend tell ending would mean robbing chance tbh think want another type chance would hate regular day job whatever seems leading maybe entitled af idiot sorry sound like trying get better seems nothing work

"I have a very serious problem that makes me have nightmares at least twice a week. I am always thinking about it and it is exhausting. It has become an obsession. I have taken extreme measures to keep it under control but it is hard to deal with it no matter what. I have non-regurgitative bulimia. In this case I sometimes eat twice or even thrice as many calories as I should in one day and then fast for the next two. Since I felt I was losing control over it I decided to move out on my own to a small house where I had no access to food or money. I've just turned 18, meaning I have it very easy since I still do not earn any money and can stay at home for days at a time. I'm terrified of ingesting more calories than I should and even at the right amount of 2100 calories a day I feel dissatisfied with my measurements. I have a hormonal problem thanks to a chromosomal abnormality I was born with and because of it all the fat goes to my legs, hips, love handles as well as my butt. I am a man. I should not have this type of body and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable if I'm not wearing the right clothes to shape my body in a way I'm okay with. I feel trapped in life and I am considering being institutionalized because I simply do not have the energy to study and carry on with life and at the same time control my eating disorder; both because of the anxiety and depression or dysthymia I present. I do not want to live with this body. And there are no hopes for normality in my life, so If I choose to live I will have to get institutionalized at some point, and if I want to stop having to deal with this---and thereby exhaust my energy---,that will have to be done rather sooner than later. I have tried to throw up after eating but I haven't got to that extreme yet because I don't want to end up with digestive or dental problems. So I did not do it in the end. But I just cannot take it for much longer and of course it is not usual for a man to have an eating disorder and this is not something I love sharing because I just feel so anxious and preoccupied about it. I am a mostly careless individual and so this is not my natural state of affairs. My parents and relatives do not think it is as serious, but that is only because they're not in my mind all the time and because they are afraid to admit their son has this hugely problematic disorder. Perhaps as well because I am at a normal, healthy weight. But all that means is that I try my best not to let myself fall.
I am tired of this. I like food and I find so much happiness in consuming it. Few things make me as euphoric. I want this to stop but I feel the emptiness of life and the anxiety of the time that passes and which keeps leaving me behind and so I eat because I feel pleasure but my biggest dream in life is to be okay with my body and get rid of this problem. The only sure way to do that would be getting INSTITUTIONALIZED at a center or place where they would ration my meals and not allow me to eat more than 1500 calories or so a day. I don't have what's necessary to exercise when it comes to mood. And even back when I used to exercise, (I would walk 4 hours 6 days a week,---around 20km per day---, do light calisthenics and weight lifting) things were not noticeably better. Maybe only a 2kg difference that is barely significative and not fully worth the effort. I cannot run. I feel dead. I like to walk but I cannot do other stuff. At least not right now. Soon I'll have a major surgery (a kidney transplant) and then I will be free to start my life as an adult but I just lament the fact that I will not be entirely free since I must get institutionalized. How will that even work? I want to get married. I want to study. Sure you can study online and that is not too bad, but what about my marriage?  

I know myself and am realistic about my situation. I know I need serious help. I cannot get out of this on my own since the reason for my ED is always there and will never fully go away (it's in my genes and this is my reality.)",1,serious problem make nightmare least twice week always thinking exhausting ha become obsession taken extreme measure keep control hard deal matter non regurgitative bulimia case sometimes eat twice even thrice many calorie one day fast next two since felt wa losing control decided move small house access food money turned 18 meaning easy since still earn money stay home day time terrified ingesting calorie even right amount 2100 calorie day feel dissatisfied measurement hormonal problem thanks chromosomal abnormality wa born fat go leg hip love handle well butt man type body make incredibly uncomfortable wearing right clothes shape body way okay feel trapped life considering institutionalized simply energy study carry life time control eating disorder anxiety depression dysthymia present want live body hope normality life choose live get institutionalized point want stop deal thereby exhaust energy done rather sooner later tried throw eating got extreme yet want end digestive dental problem end cannot take much longer course usual man eating disorder something love sharing feel anxious preoccupied mostly careless individual natural state affair parent relative think serious mind time afraid admit son ha hugely problematic disorder perhaps well normal healthy weight mean try best let fall tired like food find much happiness consuming thing make euphoric want stop feel emptiness life anxiety time pass keep leaving behind eat feel pleasure biggest dream life okay body get rid problem sure way would getting institutionalized center place would ration meal allow eat 1500 calorie day necessary exercise come mood even back used exercise would walk 4 hour 6 day week around 20km per day light calisthenics weight lifting thing noticeably better maybe 2kg difference barely significative fully worth effort cannot run feel dead like walk cannot stuff least right soon major surgery kidney transplant free start life adult lament fact entirely free since must get institutionalized even work want get married want study sure study online bad marriage know realistic situation know need serious help cannot get since reason ed always never fully go away gene reality,serious problem make nightmare least twice week always thinking exhausting ha become obsession taken extreme measure keep control hard deal matter non regurgitative bulimia case sometimes eat twice even thrice many calorie one day fast next two since felt wa losing control decided move small house access food money turned 18 meaning easy since still earn money stay home day time terrified ingesting calorie even right amount 2100 calorie day feel dissatisfied measurement hormonal problem thanks chromosomal abnormality wa born fat go leg hip love handle well butt man type body make incredibly uncomfortable wearing right clothes shape body way okay feel trapped life considering institutionalized simply energy study carry life time control eating disorder anxiety depression dysthymia present want live body hope normality life choose live get institutionalized point want stop deal thereby exhaust energy done rather sooner later tried throw eating got extreme yet want end digestive dental problem end cannot take much longer course usual man eating disorder something love sharing feel anxious preoccupied mostly careless individual natural state affair parent relative think serious mind time afraid admit son ha hugely problematic disorder perhaps well normal healthy weight mean try best let fall tired like food find much happiness consuming thing make euphoric want stop feel emptiness life anxiety time pass keep leaving behind eat feel pleasure biggest dream life okay body get rid problem sure way would getting institutionalized center place would ration meal allow eat 1500 calorie day necessary exercise come mood even back used exercise would walk 4 hour 6 day week around 20km per day light calisthenics weight lifting thing noticeably better maybe 2kg difference barely significative fully worth effort cannot run feel dead like walk cannot stuff least right soon major surgery kidney transplant free start life adult lament fact entirely free since must get institutionalized even work want get married want study sure study online bad marriage know realistic situation know need serious help cannot get since reason ed always never fully go away gene reality

"It’s heartbreaking to still have thoughts and feelings for someone who recently is getting married or was married, someone I wanted to marry but gave up on me (I don’t know, but her profile picture change, after which I deleted it from my search history. I know, block her and all that). My supposed best friend canceled on me (it’s like the third fucking time), my other friend (someone engaged) can’t be there for me really because she’s too busy and probably tired of me because of topic of my heartbreak (she told me to stop looking for love), and my other friends live too far away to visit me and/or won’t really text or call me. I went to two bars last night (I speak kind of quietly, and pretty much everyone is coupled up and looks to be twenty years older than me). I wish I could afford therapy, but I can’t because I’m not working (I applied for a job I haven’t heard back from). And I have a weird relationship with a small group that goes to my church on Sunday nights, because when I’m there it’s fine, but no one gives me their phone number to text or call or hang out with. I guess I sound pretty pathetic and desperate describing all this, but I just am tired of working on myself and somehow expecting to be happy alone pretty much all the time when I have needs for affection and touch and stimulating conversations. I hate that as a single guy with not a lot of friends I’m most likely to make anyone uncomfortable (people are weary of someone with very few friends, because they must be a creep or toxic person). Even God is withdrawn from me. I know killing myself is more or less attention-getting. I’m just tired of getting my hopes up about anything, about reaching out because no one really gives a shit about being there daily for me or really how I feel or what I think. I just feel used by others wanting to feel good about themselves. Fuck people for overlooking me when I’ve asked for help, for those who prey on and scam lonely people.

"26 F. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD/ADD 10 years ago.
Recently the past few weeks I’ve been so incredibly annoyed/angry/sad at everything in my life. I wouldn’t mind leaving the earth for a bit to catch a fucking break. I have been suicidal before and I feel I may be on that road again but I’m trying my hardest not to get back to that dark place.
I still live at home and am a middle child, I’ve had it rough growing up and always been the shitty child and one with problems.. (My brother (27) is building his own house and soon to be moving out, and my sister (23) just moved into her own house she brought.
I feel so useless and no where near on track with my life. I work full time but HATE my job. I’ve been in lockdown for weeks due to so many numbers of Covid in my town (I’m in Australia and it’s been hell for us here for the past year and a half in constant lockdowns)
I know this is also contributing to being down and alone.
I snap at anything and everything / everyone for nothing. I’m so angry. I can’t explain it. I also have NO friends whatsoever and the only one I do have is more interested in getting boys than her friends.
I feel I get up every morning, work (been working from home for a year and a half now which is annoying) shower , eat and go to bed. On my weekends I lay in bed all day on my phone or laptop. I have no social life.
I’ve put on 15 kilos since covid started as I do nothing. I have tried exercising but can’t stick to it - I also got bloods done and everything came back fine. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I know I need to get back to my psych, but she’s recently moved and now lives in another state and I can only video call her.

"Hello! 

I'm new, so I hope this is ok to post.

I've been dealing with depression for many years, but feel like I only was able to put a name to and call it that for the past 5 years. 

I feel like my depression makes me struggle with motivation and avoidant about certain things I have to do for work. Recently though I have been struggling to determine if my inability to do focused work is due to my depression or if I have underlying attention issues.

Does anyone have advice or experience with this? Can't having attention issues (like ADHD) make you frustrated and as a result depressed if untreated? How can you tell them apart? I have also have a similar question about undiagnosed autism and social isolation. How can you tell them apart?

Thank you for any insights!",1,hello new hope ok post dealing depression many year feel like wa able put name call past 5 year feel like depression make struggle motivation avoidant certain thing work recently though struggling determine inability focused work due depression underlying attention issue doe anyone advice experience attention issue like adhd make frustrated result depressed untreated tell apart also similar question undiagnosed autism social isolation tell apart thank insight,hello new hope ok post dealing depression many year feel like wa able put name call past 5 year feel like depression make struggle motivation avoidant certain thing work recently though struggling determine inability focused work due depression underlying attention issue doe anyone advice experience attention issue like adhd make frustrated result depressed untreated tell apart also similar question undiagnosed autism social isolation tell apart thank insight
"I've been struggling for a while now. I had a hard time at secondary school and when I was around 14 I started to experience what I think are symptoms of depression,  constantly tired, sleeping 12+ hours a day, stopped talking to friends outside of school and I would get really sad randomly throughout the day. at 15 I developed a drug habit, it was a way of dealing with how I was feeling but in the long run made it worse. shortly after this I started getting passive suicidal thoughts, I never actually wanted to die but the thought that I could always od on painkillers as an easy way out would come up regularly. at 17 I started counselling and stopped using most drugs for a while, I stopped doing counselling after 6 months as I found it wasn't really helping.

Iam now 18, and while the bursts of sadness and anxiety aren't as common as they used to be I still feel apathetic towards life, iam constantly tired even though I don't do much of anything. some days it takes me hours to muster up the motivation to get up and make breakfast. Completing my assignments is almost impossible, even if I manage to make myself sit at the computer I can't focus. 

recently I've been thinking of going to my gp to possibly get diagnosed and get antidepressants (had blood tests for deficiencies when it started at 14) but sometimes I feel like iam subconsciously faking it as an excuse for being lazy.

"I’m currently very unhappy and have no idea what to do. I’m on 2 anti depressants + Adderall and I’m just increasing and increasing just to kind of stay alive. I’ve also been through 3 therapists since COVID. I feel a bit like I’m on life support, just being kept alive so that the people I love don’t have to say goodbye and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

I used to have purpose, goals and huge drive but now I don’t care about any of them. They’ve all become meaningless to me. There’s nothing I want to do enough to go and do it. I do work though, it’s a job I was striving for for a long time and I found some success at 28 one could be proud of. I am proud but I don’t feel like going on.

I’m single, overweight, insecure, can’t keep a relationship and I don’t know if I’ve ever experienced mutual romantic love. That’s something I would like… and a husband and children and to be a stay at home mom… I just can’t make it happen for myself. I think it would be easier if I lost weight, and I know I’m capable of it but just knowing the unfairness of people being able to find love, happiness and meaning while being fat makes me feel unmotivated. Like why can’t I be loved for me? Me as I am, I’m not good enough. I’m not good enough. I have never been good enough. And that’s not fair.

Why am I suffering through this? To what end? Why should I make changes? Because life might get better? I might have a few days of Sunshine between the pain? I didn’t sign up for this. I do not want to be alive.

I suffered a lot of physical abuse until I moved out at 18. I also grew up in a cult. Since realizing it was a cult and having my whole worldview shattered to pieces is when the depression became unmanageable.

I’m not sure what will help, but I’m scared to die. I’m scared that there’s a possibility that death might not be peace. I’m scared of the potential of continued consciousness. I think if I knew for a fact that when you die, it’s really done- I would do it in a heartbeatz.",1,currently unhappy idea 2 anti depressant adderall increasing increasing kind stay alive also 3 therapist since covid feel bit like life support kept alive people love say goodbye nothing used purpose goal huge drive care become meaningless nothing want enough go work though job wa striving long time found success 28 one could proud proud feel like going single overweight insecure keep relationship know ever experienced mutual romantic love something would like husband child stay home mom make happen think would easier lost weight know capable knowing unfairness people able find love happiness meaning fat make feel unmotivated like loved good enough good enough never good enough fair suffering end make change life might get better might day sunshine pain sign want alive suffered lot physical abuse moved 18 also grew cult since realizing wa cult whole worldview shattered piece depression became unmanageable sure help scared die scared possibility death might peace scared potential continued consciousness think knew fact die really done would heartbeatz,currently unhappy idea 2 anti depressant adderall increasing increasing kind stay alive also 3 therapist since covid feel bit like life support kept alive people love say goodbye nothing used purpose goal huge drive care become meaningless nothing want enough go work though job wa striving long time found success 28 one could proud proud feel like going single overweight insecure keep relationship know ever experienced mutual romantic love something would like husband child stay home mom make happen think would easier lost weight know capable knowing unfairness people able find love happiness meaning fat make feel unmotivated like loved good enough good enough never good enough fair suffering end make change life might get better might day sunshine pain sign want alive suffered lot physical abuse moved 18 also grew cult since realizing wa cult whole worldview shattered piece depression became unmanageable sure help scared die scared possibility death might peace scared potential continued consciousness think knew fact die really done would heartbeatz

"Hello, sorry for a long post. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this.

I'll start with events 4 years ago when it all started.  I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for.

I'm from a small village and I have some good friends here. We  were always considered to be the  ""bad guys"" because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought.

She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her ( stupid I know) I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine.

And that's when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating,  lying scumbag. I didn't see that at the time but now it's very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me

After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober.  I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 

4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I don't really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job.

Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i  snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag.

I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasn't the man I was when we first met,  but of course she didn't believe it, why would she ?  Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But she's probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldn't have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in.

I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago.

It's been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 9-5 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I can't do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. 

At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I haven't touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but she's always busy and takes a long time to reply.

I'm just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further.

"21F have been dealing with major depression since early teens. I have been living by myself for over a year now in a small one bedroom apartment with my little dog. My boyfriend is in the navy so we are long distance so he isn’t here for me a the time (physically) I’ve been dealing with a roach infestation for months now and it’s been a real struggle. He surprised me at home two months ago and he was here when it was at its worst. He noticed what was going on and confronted me about it and how I need to do something about it. It was a very emotional night for me and he was very caring and nice but stern about what was happening. He helped me clean and kill as many as we could and the next morning took me to the leasing office to tell them. He told them for me pretty much. I was so devastated and embarrassed about what was happening if he hadn’t been there I don’t know if I would’ve been able to do it. I’ve been going through the process of extermination and it just ended. The problem is probably 90% solved and couldn’t have done it without him. Im just so ashamed and embarrassed about how bad I’ve become without even noticing. I know cleaning gets hard for me especially living alone and being depressed. And I don’t have anyone else living here to make sure things are clean for. Im honestly struggling this whole thing has been so stressful. It’s been throwing me into a deeper depressive state when I just sit here and can’t bring myself to do anything.  I feel so awful I don’t know what to do to fix it. I wish I had someone here to help me clean and keep up my house while I work. Not to mention im struggling financially and at in school full time. Im tired and stressed and it’s getting to be so much to do on my own.  I Feel stuck. I don’t really need advice I just wanted to say all this. Just a lot going on and just wanted to scream into the void. 
Also if you also struggle to clean just please do enough so you don’t get bugs. It’s awful and it’s not worth it.

"This is my last ditch effort.

Everytime I almost start to make an ounce of good progress I get drop kicked even further behind than before. 

I’m so sick. I’m so sad. I’m so lonely. I’m so hungry. I’m so sore. 

And even though I want to put in the work to get better, I’m so insanely poor that I can’t get infront of anything in order to do so.

I have no one that I can go to. No family. Nothing.

So, as my last attempt, I’m coming here to ask for any fucking amount of money that anyone can spare. I’m sitting in a cafe using wifi on my phone that I don’t even have a provider for anymore.

"I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life. I've had the ""I just want to sleep"" kind, the ""showering feels too hard"" kind, and the ""life is joyless"" kind.  I want to share with you what I've learned in the hopes that it helps you.  

😔 😡 Depression is a form of grief.  Your whole body is telling you something is missing from your life- meaning, joy, hope, rest, a loved one.  See if you can figure out what you're grieving.  Allow that anger, sadness, and pain to be there for as long as you need.  Cry, punch a pillow, and let it out.  Then, when you're ready to feel peace, hope, gratitude, or joy, try (baby steps first!) one of these things:

1) Give. 🎁

Doing something for others creates connection, meaning, and joy in your life.  Giving cements or grows your social network, which has been proven to improve [survivorship](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23098436/) in cancer patients. 

Feel like utter shit? Text a thank you to someone.  Thank you for... I appreciate the way you... My life is better because you...

When you're ready, offer a compliment, reach out to someone who's lonely, plan an activity that someone will enjoy, write a thank you note, make or buy (and give!) a present, make food for someone who's sick grieving, visit someone who's sick or grieving, share joy in someone else's good fortune, and/or offer condolences and sympathy for their bad fortune.

2) Move. 😅👟 

Endorphins reduce pain and act like morphine in your body.  And exercise can help unfuzz your brain, even creating a feeling of euphoria.  

Feel like utter shit?  Try stretching in bed or go for a short walk.  

When you're ready, ride a bike, do beginner bodyweight exercises (lots of YouTube resources here), dance, run, climb stairs, play drums, play sports, swim, hike, kayak, play on a playground, and/or do yoga.  

Tips: Keep trying new things until you find something that makes you feel excellent and you enjoy.  Bribe yourself with your favorite music or TV show, or a reward afterwords, if you need to.  The more you exert yourself, the better you'll feel; sweat is great medicine!

3) Appreciate. 💜 

""It is gratefulness which makes the soul great."" - Abraham Joshua Heschel

Feel like utter shit?  Lie in bed and play music you love.

When you're ready, spend time in nature, admire a garden, list golden moments, savor great food, bask in momentos, and/or write three things you're grateful for (daily).

4) Play. 🤣

Life doesn't have to be so serious all the time.  Laugh and goof off; it's good for you!

Feel like utter shit?  Watch a good comedy.

When you're ready, play a board game, dance to happy music, sing (alone or with friends), play on a playground, play make-believe, play whatever a child wants to play, wear a costume, play cards, play outside, watch improv or sketch comedy, play dress up, and/or watch stand-up.

5) Sit. 🕯️

Your body and spirit need rest.  Relax and rejuvenate.

Feel like utter shit? Lie down and notice your breath for a minute.

When you're ready, lounge in the bathtub, do a guided [meditation](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/podcasts/emotional-wellness), sleep, do yin or restorative yoga, notice your breathing, do a [body scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15q-N-_kkrU), stretch, color in a coloring book, smell fancy soaps (or baking spices), take a nap, and/or draw.

6) Love. 💕 

""There is only one happiness in life: to love and be loved."" George Sand

Feel like utter shit? Snuggle a stuffed animal.

When you're ready, give hugs, cuddle a pet, snuggle a person, hold hands, and/or spend time with a loved one.

7. Improve. 📈

""Strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection."" -Kim Collins

Feel like utter shit? Think of one thing you'd like to learn one day.

When you're ready, solve a nagging problem, ask for help, write a letter to a politician, floss your teeth, sign a petition, compose an op/ed, create a list of goals, begin to accomplish a goal, start learning something new, take a shower, tackle a chore, and/or practice an instrument.

8. Beautify. 🌈 

[Beauty is indespensable.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/07/opinion/andre-aciman-why-is-beauty-important.html) As Plato says, beauty ""causes the soul to grow wings.""

Feel like utter shit? Light a candle.

When you're ready, wear perfume/ cologne, buy flowers, hang art, decorate for the season/ holiday, paint your toes (dudes, too!), cut a bouqet, bring nature into your home, create an alter, set a beautiful table, cook or bake something yummy, wear gorgeous clothing, tidy up a small space, clean, organize, and/or write poetry.

 🌲 🌳 🌸 🌹  🌵💧 ❄️ 🏔 🏜 

 If you only have the energy to do one thing, get yourself into nature for an hour.  A walk in the woods/ with a view/ along the water is movement, beautifying, appreciation, and improving yourself all at once!  Try it and see how it affects you.

💜 🍀 

This won't last forever.  You can and will make your own beautiful life.  I'm rooting for you.

"I feel like I'm only existing in a fog. I can't remember the last time I feel clear. I feel so unmotivated and it just keeps getting worse. Every time I think i'm doing a little better I hit a new low. I don't feel in control of my own body any more and I don't feel conscious. Every time I find a new support structure I feel like it gets ripped away from me. 

I've been trying to grapple for 8-9 months since a traumatic breakup with my ex that ended with the police being called on me by my ex's parents for engaging in ""deviant activities"". The police were obligated to call my school, my school my parents, and my parents calling me a sex monster. The worst part however is the lack of closure. I never was able to reach out to her to apologize or just check in with her. I'll check in on her from time to time through insta, and she's got a new boyfriend now so that seems like closure in a sense. I never fully healed from having someone I became attached to and opened myself up to/trusted just disappear so suddenly. Most positive relationship in my life gone. 

As a mentally ill person I feel like I only attract mentally ill people. That makes every friendship I have end in an explosion where they have a schizophrenic-like attack against me that I somehow get fucking blamed for. No one around me can own their own mistakes because they're too stoned to notice. 

I would be too if it weren't for my ""amazing Navy internship"" that's supposed to get me into fucking stanford or whatever. I had better for being emotionally abused by an 87 year old ivory tower bitch for the past year and a half. I don't even do exciting important work that makes me want to be in Computer Science/Engineering. I don't even feel like i'm doing anything. And what do I get for my allegiance to her, through her plots to take down professors, and 10pm calls for new assignments? Nothing. I need to write my own recommendation letter. The lazy ass bitch can't even do that. And all this for not being able to smoke weed, yeah fair trade. 

Before quarantine sophomore year I was kicked out of my school's robotics team due to a bad joke I made towards a teammate. I had grown from the incident, got help, and petitioned to rejoin the team. The mentor made me reveal my own personal growth, intimate personal details about my life especially pertaining to my break up with my ex GF. And even after all that they called me a liability and barred me from rejoining. It was the one place where I felt good and mentally awake and I fucked it up.

Current relationships feel like shit too. They're all crazy, aren't as interested in me as I am into them or just abusive. Maybe I need to just give up on a relationship while I'm this sick. I can't put this shit on anyone close to me because I'd just end up hurting them.

Beyond the haze school is just kicking my ass left and right. And I just need to 'deal with it'. Even though when I get home I'm in such a fucking haze that I can barely take care of myself to eat, sleep, and bathe. The club I started got barred from going into competition because I fucked up and wasn't attentive enough. 

And tonight, which set off this beautiful manic episode was the fact that I just found out my friend died, and no one is telling me how. He loved life so much and was getting so much better with everything and he's just gone. My thoughts have been so fucking loud the past few months, but especially in the past few days. 

On my depression: I've had it for about 6? years but its gotten really bad since quarantine. I am seeing a therapist but i don't know why it isn't working. Maybe i'm just too lazy to use her help. I'm beyond distractible but I don't know if that's because my brain is starved for dopeamine from the depression or because of possible ADHD. I have heavy physical symptoms of depression. I've also developed a ticcing disorder which exhibits complex motor and verbal tics, making me feel like an embarrassment, even more of an annoyance than I usually am, and a danger to the children I work with as a scout leader.

I feel like this is the right time to kill myself. I'm the bad guy to my friends so they won't be sad. My family knows I'm this ill so i'd just be another teen tragedy. Its always the wrong people who die so why not make it the right one this time. These don't seem like temporary issues to me either. My dad also carries this level of depression and anxiety so its likely to be a life long battle. I have a history of mental illness and substance abuse on both sides so that'll sure be fun to either endure or avoid. I just don't know how much longer I can go on like this, living the life I live. I disassociate for most of the day and feel like i'm living in a video game with NPCs and side quests and all that. Or like today: I'll just sit around on youtube, reddit, or tiktok all day. I stayed home from school today in order to work on 2 huge papers and what'd I do? Nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. I feel like such a piece of depressed shit and I don't know what to do.",1,feel like existing fog remember last time feel clear feel unmotivated keep getting worse every time think little better hit

"I struggle with intense depression and anxiety, a majority of the time I can't even leave my room and suffer severe panic attacks on bad days when outside.

I gathered the strength to go to my local doctor, I live in a remote African village so infrastructure is near non-existant and getting anywhere is a struggle as is getting help.

I explained my situation, explained my troubles, and he told me that I am ""Too smart for depression or anxiety medication"". I am not smart, what does ""smart"" in this context even mean?

Everyone worships this man and he is the only doctor within my travel bubble. I have been called ""wicked"" for speaking out against him, that ""No one wants a part in my pity party"". 

I don't know what to do, my condition already alienates me from everyone around me and this has further othered me to many people.",1,struggle intense depression anxiety majority time even leave room suffer severe panic attack bad day outside gathered strength go local doctor live remote african village infrastructure near non existant getting anywhere struggle getting help explained situation explained trouble told smart depression anxiety medication smart doe smart context even mean everyone worship man doctor within travel bubble called wicked speaking one want part pity party know condition already alienates everyone around ha othered many people,struggle intense depression anxiety majority time even leave room suffer severe panic attack bad day outside gathered strength go local doctor live remote african village infrastructure near non existant getting anywhere struggle getting help explained situation explained trouble told smart depression anxiety medication smart doe smart context even mean everyone worship man doctor within travel bubble called wicked speaking one want part pity party know condition already alienates everyone around ha othered many people

"I just started college a month ago, and I’m starting to regress again. I’ve become more recluse, which I didn’t think was possible. I spend a majority of my time alone, whether that be eating or studying, which seem to be my only constants. I feel distant from my classmates and they probably view me as the awkward virgin. I’ve started smoking again even though it nearly killed me before. I force myself to masturbate to get some sense of comfort about my situation. Suicidal thoughts are becoming consistent again. I don’t have someone to talk to about myself. The closest I’ve ever come to actually talking about myself was when I was on shrooms, but I physically could not describe my pain and just ended up breaking down. I use alcohol and drugs to escape from myself because I hate who I am. At least when I’m intoxicated I feel like I have purpose. I’ve always put up a facade of calm and happiness, but whenever someone gets close I push them away because I’m afraid of what they’ll see. I’m tired. I don’t know if I can do this anymore .",1,started college month ago starting regress become recluse think wa possible spend majority time alone whether eating studying seem constant feel distant classmate probably view awkward virgin started smoking even though nearly killed force masturbate get sense comfort situation suicidal thought becoming consistent someone talk closest ever come actually talking wa wa shrooms physically could describe pain ended breaking use alcohol drug escape hate least intoxicated feel like purpose always put facade calm happiness whenever someone get close push away afraid see tired know anymore,started college month ago starting regress become recluse think wa possible spend majority time alone whether eating studying seem constant feel distant classmate probably view awkward virgin started smoking even though nearly killed force masturbate get sense comfort situation suicidal thought becoming consistent someone talk closest ever come actually talking wa wa shrooms physically could describe pain ended breaking use alcohol drug escape hate least intoxicated feel like purpose always put facade calm happiness whenever someone get close push away afraid see tired know anymore
"Hello everyone! I’m here to just ask some questions on what did some of y’all do to help your partners that suffer severe depression and anxiety. 

I’ve currently been talking to this person and we both hit it off right from the bat. I’m talking scarily accurate stuff that we have in common. This person then told me “since we are talking more frequently, I figured I’d let you know I suffer severe depression and anxiety. So it’s hard to keep in touch with people who have it and I understand if you don’t wanna be around.”(clearly warning me that our convos won’t be like this) Of course my answer was “I totally understand! Just know I’m always around if you wanna ear to listen to :)” 

So it’s been two months now and I know some of y’all would think “why are you so invested, go live your life” which I have been doing. But if it does work out and we do date for real. What advice can I do for me when im in this? This is just so im aware. 

In my eyes it’s clear we like each other, despite it only online. I’ve tried to see if I could do what my friends told me and it’s to try and meet other people. But none of them clicked like how it clicked with the person I’m talking to. They tell me she probably leading you on and I would simply say, “ well why would they send 8 min audios about what we’re talking about? Or literally offer to watch one of my fav Anime in theaters the next month? It’s her depression bro.” 

Overall I understand her position and I’m still living my life conquering my goals. But still in the back of my mind, if we do end up maybe being a thing. What would I do?

Also to add, I’m still trying to wrap around how should I give them space? Like what should I be saying? Because usually I would problem send this person a message saying, “ have an amazing day! Always will care and depression can’t change that. So get yo cute ass up! I’m proud always!” Something like that. But I don’t also wanna overwhelm them so how often? Or should I just not?",1,hello everyone ask question help partner suffer severe depression anxiety currently talking person hit right bat talking scarily accurate stuff common person told since talking frequently figured let know suffer severe depression anxiety hard keep touch people understand wanna around clearly warning convos like course answer wa totally understand know always around wanna ear listen two month know would think invested go live life doe work date real advice im im aware eye clear like despite online tried see could friend told try meet people none clicked like clicked person talking tell probably leading would simply say well would send 8 min audio talking literally offer watch one fav anime theater next month depression bro overall understand position still living life conquering goal still back mind end maybe thing would also add still trying wrap around give space like saying usually would problem send person message saying amazing day always care depression change get yo cute proud always something like also wanna overwhelm often,hello everyone ask question help partner suffer severe depression anxiety currently talking person hit right bat talking scarily accurate stuff common person told since talking frequently figured let know suffer severe depression anxiety hard keep touch people understand wanna around clearly warning convos like course answer wa totally understand know always around wanna ear listen two month know would think invested go live life doe work date real advice im im aware eye clear like despite online tried see could friend told try meet people none clicked like clicked person talking tell probably leading would simply say well would send 8 min audio talking literally offer watch one fav anime theater next month depression bro overall understand position still living life conquering goal still back mind end maybe thing would also add still trying wrap around give space like saying usually would problem send person message saying amazing day always care depression change get yo cute proud always something like also wanna overwhelm often

"I just discovered that my family attempted to do something quite life changingly bad to me behind my back, and when I confronted them about it, they lied to me and made it seem like I'm crazy and I made it all up in my head. I don't have any sorts of mental health issues that cause stuff like that though, I'm quite sane, I have depression.

I'm also quite alone as I'm in one of those inevitable phases of friends all leaving, and this is usually when I look for new ones, but I'm tired of new people, so I'm just going to let them go and be alone. I have absolutely no one to talk to about any of this, and when they were around, I rarely talked about any depressive feelings because I don't want to scare anyone. 

I'm tired of living. I just want to sleep all the time, but that's impossible. I've thought about trying to take some of the drugs I have to sleep all the time, but my supplier is gone and I'm trying to save whatever I have left for a backup suicide if my first plan doesn't work (although it really should).

Life is just absolutely awful, I don't see any benefit to living it for me. People find some way to delude themselves that it's good, but it's usually just misery after misery. One thing ends and another one starts, and I'm tired of this cycle of miserable things happening over and over again.

My brother is also dying. My family seems to think he's going to make some miraculous recovery, but I've done enough research to know that he's in the end stages of his life. I feel like I need to die before him so that I don't become the emotional crutch for my family and some sort of replacement for him, because then I'll be forced to stick it out with them, and it'll make me more miserable which I can't deal with. They definitely care about my brother more as they mostly ignore my existence and always have, but I fear that if he's gone, they'll turn all of their attention onto me, which I don't want.

I feel like I should start putting all of my stuff in order (will and stuff) to make my death easier on my family, but I don't have the motivation to not attempt sleep all day instead. I've been stalling this suicide for a year now, and I'm done waiting for a miracle to fall out of the sky for me and for life to suddenly be good for me. It isn't and it won't be.

I have a psychologist but recently that's been feeling more like a chore than anything else and it feels like it isn't helping anymore. It only feels like it's helping when my mood is already stable, but when I'm miserable, nothing helps. Stable moods are extremely rare though, it's only happened once since the start of 2020, so I guess my depressive episodes last for longer than a year at a time, and only feel a little better for like 2 months, before depression returns.

Please don't report me to reddit suicide resources, that's more annoying than anything because those helplines are largely useless and not even in my country.",1,discovered family attempted something quite life changingly bad behind back confronted lied made seem like crazy made head sort mental health issue cause stuff like though quite sane depression also quite alone one inevitable phase friend leaving usually look new one tired new people going let go alone absolutely one talk around rarely talked depressive feeling want scare anyone tired living want sleep time impossible thought trying take drug sleep time supplier gone trying save whatever left backup suicide first plan work although really life absolutely awful see benefit living people find way delude good usually misery misery one thing end another one start tired cycle miserable thing happening brother also dying family seems think going make miraculous recovery done enough research know end stage life feel like need die become emotional crutch family sort replacement forced stick make miserable deal definitely care brother mostly ignore existence always fear gone turn attention onto want feel like start putting stuff order stuff make death easier family motivation attempt sleep day instead stalling suicide year done waiting miracle fall sky life suddenly good psychologist recently feeling like chore anything else feel like helping anymore feel like helping mood already stable miserable nothing help stable mood extremely rare though happened since start 2020 guess depressive episode last longer year time feel little better like 2 month depression return please report reddit suicide resource annoying anything helplines largely useless even country,discovered family attempted something quite life changingly bad behind back confronted lied made seem like crazy made head sort mental health issue cause stuff like though quite sane depression also quite alone one inevitable phase friend leaving usually look new one tired new people going let go alone absolutely one talk around rarely talked depressive feeling want scare anyone tired living want sleep time impossible thought trying take drug sleep time supplier gone trying save whatever left backup suicide first plan work although really life absolutely awful see benefit living people find way delude good usually misery misery one thing end another one start tired cycle miserable thing happening brother also dying family seems think going make miraculous recovery done enough research know end stage life feel like need die become emotional crutch family sort replacement forced stick make miserable deal definitely care brother mostly ignore existence always fear gone turn attention onto want feel like start putting stuff order stuff make death easier family motivation attempt sleep day instead stalling suicide year done waiting miracle fall sky life suddenly good psychologist recently feeling like chore anything else feel like helping anymore feel like helping mood already stable miserable nothing help stable mood extremely rare though happened since start 2020 guess depressive episode last longer year time feel little better like 2 month depression return please report reddit suicide resource annoying anything helplines largely useless even country

"I'm currently depressed and am regularly going through some rough times and plenty of problems. Clearly, I'm not able to get into a relationship, nor do I even want to until I get at least some of the significant issues dealt with.

However, all of this makes me feel extra bad about myself because I really do crave some form of intimacy and affection, but I won't get it anytime soon. I try to handle my life and not end up crying each night for not having someone by my side, but even science says you can't be happy if you aren't getting any affection on a regular basis. It's just... awful.

So I've been wondering, how do you accept such a situation without becoming even more severely depressed?

Before someone suggests the obvious: I already have a pet, I tried hugging pillows, heating blankets, and am trying to socialize with people in general. All these things help, but not for long. There is no supplement for genuine love and affection from another human being.",1,currently depressed regularly going rough time plenty problem clearly able get relationship even want get least significant issue dealt however make feel extra bad really crave form intimacy affection get anytime soon try handle life end cry night someone side even science say happy getting affection regular basis awful wondering accept situation without becoming even severely depressed someone suggests obvious already pet tried hugging pillow heating blanket trying socialize people general thing help long supplement genuine love affection another human,currently depressed regularly going rough time plenty problem clearly able get relationship even want get least significant issue dealt however make feel extra bad really crave form intimacy affection get anytime soon try handle life end cry night someone side even science say happy getting affection regular basis awful wondering accept situation without becoming even severely depressed someone suggests obvious already pet tried hugging pillow heating blanket trying socialize people general thing help long supplement genuine love affection another human

"I have some questions about depression. A friend of mine had depression in the past.. i think he's having again another occurrence.

So i have some questions...

1. If someone had depression episodes at 13, 15, 16-17 , and now... since 19/20-22 (maybe depression, maybe not). Does that mean, this person might have clinical/chronic depression that will carry all his life?

I'm asking this because he's acting weird... but refuses to see the doctor (stomach and headaches pains)/sleeping issues or therapist, since he's weird (lack of interest and apathy) and other things.

2. Can depression come back with diferent sympthons?

He used to self-harm and suicidal thoughts and other things in the past (age 16-17)... now (21-22) he's pretty chill, only hides his arms (long sleeves in hot summer) but not a single recent scar when i ask him to show me his arms.. no suicidal thoughts or such, he tells me he's in a much better place now.

"Okay so I've been dealing with depression and two eating disorders on and off for the past 11 years (F21).

For the past few months I have been depressed again. However, it isn't quite as severe as it was a year ago (the first time I started on meds and actually felt better until I was full blown anorexic), and it makes me doubt myself. 

Am I making this up? Am I just a lazy, attention-seeking fraud? I'm at uni and I find it hard to keep up. I am so, so tired and heavy in my body all the time, and I am just hopeless about the future. It takes me days to finally get in the shower. I cry a lot. I can't focus at all. It would just be easier to not be here. I feel like the biggest burden of everyone in my life, and it pains me to see them worry about me - again.

"Hi everyone,

Please tell me if anyone has had experience with this?

So I have not been to work since last Tuesday. I have been a in a severe state of depression for days and days now. I've literally just stayed in bed and taken the kids to school (late ugh). I hadn't done really anything else. I've barely been sleeping.. like an hour here and a couple hours there. So that's means it's been about 7 full days. It was almost at the point where I was thinking about checking myself in somewhere to get help. 

But I woke up today .. and I just... cleaned... and cleaned.. and cleaned.. like the entire house. I just kept going like I had an I infinite amount of energy. Dishes, laundry, mop, swept, vacuumed, ect. I just kept going and going and going all day long. Like wtf is wrong me?! I'm so confused!!!

"Turned 23 a few days ago. I'm on my first semester at a business school/university, but strongly suspect I'm being neither true to myself, nor healthy enough to continue.

I'm from rural Denmark. I have mild aspergers. Was diagnosed late at 20 (late 3rd HS year, started schooling a year later than my peers and had a boarding school year)

During HS the lack of proper support for my undiagnosed aspergers affected me negatively in my math and physics classes, which were my primary A-levels.

These were otherwise subjects I had done alright in during my earlier schooling. Although math required effort. Physics I loved, and I wanted do something really tech-heavy with my life.

There was clearly some anxiety and depression. I had trouble decoding my math/physics teachers, who weren't very emotive or pedagogical. In addition to having difficulty knowing what to focus on/processing what they wrote and said at the same time.

I had to take a 4th year to redo my last year of HS math/physics/engineering, but barely passed any of them. Social anxiety and difficulty focusing on the work led to bad impressions on my classmates and I had to do my exams alone.

At this point I'm 21. I got support for structuring things, but the true issues I couldn't see was my anxiety, depression and the teacher-dynamic. I should have transfered, but didn't know I could. We lived so far away from any other school, and I was wearing blinders mentally.

And I never thought my mental state was that bad. ""You just need to work out, sleep and meet some people"" is what I thought. Despite having suicidal thoughts since my second year of HS.

Then Covid hit. My sabbatical year where I turned 22 had me become a shut-in. I was terribly depressed, feeling I had no identity or future. I became afraid of interacting with my family and experiencing the world outside. I had no wild experiences on my own, a job or IRL friends I could bring myself to reach out to.

(How my parents didn't realize something was wrong, I don't understand, but I just could't come clear with my issues)

I did visit a psychologist and such. Some things improved, but the depression and anxiety never went away. I always thought my suicidal thoughts were not serious enough somehow, as I weren't make plans for going through with it, in my mind.

When time came to apply for Uni, I felt I improved. I relearned some HS math, but still didn't have the most solid grip on it. During summer I went on a vacation with my family, and I moved in with my sister and my grandma for Uni start as I looked for my own student housing.

But in the first 3 weeks my sister became very sick and had to miss school. This led to a lot of stress, arguments, and me being unable to focus on the coursework. In addition to me being really worried about what little math is here. (Microeconomics.)

...And starting so soon after a year of being a depressed shut-in. I feel I'm so far behind everything there's no reason to continue, even if the content is interesting. And that I clearly can't maintain the drive with my mental baggage. I always wanted to learn how to code and work with computers, but I was so blind to what I wanted and too depressed to try anything in my gap year.

And then there's my age. Here in Denmark many start their Uni experience at 20, but I just turned 23. If I start something new I'll turn 24 on my 1st semester. And I'll be in my later 20s when I'm done with a masters. And is it coding I want? How good can I get with such a late start? Stuff like that is what I worry about. I feel like I'm far too late to not know what I like to do. I'm both older and wiser than I was at 18-20, but I feel I can less than those my junior.

I've had so few life experienes, and my family were shocked when I told them about my suicidal thoughts. I'm going to see a psychiatrist and hopefully get on some medication, but the future seems so dark. I'm glad I took this shot a Uni, to see what it's like. But I've wasted years not knowing how bad I had it. And I worry so much about starting a career so late.",1,turned 23 day ago first semester business school university strongly suspect neither true healthy enough continue rural denmark mild aspergers wa diagnosed late 20 late 3rd h year started schooling year later peer boarding school year h lack proper support undiagnosed aspergers affected negatively math physic class primary level otherwise subject done alright earlier schooling although math required effort physic loved wanted something really tech heavy life wa clearly anxiety depression trouble decoding math physic teacher emotive pedagogical addition difficulty knowing focus processing wrote said time take 4th year redo last year h math physic engineering barely passed social anxiety difficulty focusing work led bad impression classmate exam alone point 21 got support structuring thing true issue see wa anxiety depression teacher dynamic transfered know could lived far away school wa wearing blinder mentally never thought mental state wa bad need work sleep meet people thought despite suicidal thought since second year h covid hit sabbatical year turned 22 become shut wa terribly depressed feeling identity future became afraid interacting family experiencing world outside wild experience job irl friend could bring reach parent realize something wa wrong understand could come clear issue visit psychologist thing improved depression anxiety never went away always thought suicidal thought serious enough somehow make plan going mind time came apply uni felt improved relearned h math still solid grip summer went vacation family moved sister grandma uni start looked student housing first 3 week sister became sick miss school led lot stress argument unable focus coursework addition really worried little math microeconomics starting soon year depressed shut feel far behind everything reason continue even content interesting clearly maintain drive mental baggage always wanted learn code work computer wa blind wanted depressed try anything gap year age denmark many start uni experience 20 turned 23 start something new turn 24 1st semester later 20 done master coding want good get late start stuff like worry feel like far late know like older wiser wa 18 20 feel le junior life experienes family shocked told suicidal thought going see psychiatrist hopefully get medication future seems dark glad took shot uni see like wasted year knowing bad worry much starting career late,turned 23 day ago first semester business school university strongly suspect neither true healthy enough continue rural denmark mild aspergers wa diagnosed late 20 late 3rd h year started schooling year later peer boarding school year h lack proper support undiagnosed aspergers affected negatively math physic class primary level otherwise subject done alright earlier schooling although math required effort physic loved wanted something really tech heavy life wa clearly anxiety depression trouble decoding math physic teacher emotive pedagogical addition difficulty knowing focus processing wrote said time take 4th year redo last year h math physic engineering barely passed social anxiety difficulty focusing work led bad impression classmate exam alone point 21 got support structuring thing true issue see wa anxiety depression teacher dynamic transfered know could lived far away school wa wearing blinder mentally never thought mental state wa bad need work sleep meet people thought despite suicidal thought since second year h covid hit sabbatical year turned 22 become shut wa terribly depressed feeling identity future became afraid interacting family experiencing world outside wild experience job irl friend could bring reach parent realize something wa wrong understand could come clear issue visit psychologist thing improved depression anxiety never went away always thought suicidal thought serious enough somehow make plan going mind time came apply uni felt improved relearned h math still solid grip summer went vacation family moved sister grandma uni start looked student housing first 3 week sister became sick miss school led lot stress argument unable focus coursework addition really worried little math microeconomics starting soon year depressed shut feel far behind everything reason continue even content interesting clearly maintain drive mental baggage always wanted learn code work computer wa blind wanted depressed try anything gap year age denmark many start uni experience 20 turned 23 start something new turn 24 1st semester later 20 done master coding want good get late start stuff like worry feel like far late know like older wiser wa 18 20 feel le junior life experienes family shocked told suicidal thought going see psychiatrist hopefully get medication future seems dark glad took shot uni see like wasted year knowing bad worry much starting career late
"Heyy there!
I just found out that a very good online friend of mine suffers from depression and feeling down.

Initally she just asked for advice regarding a crush of hers who already is in a relationship. When talking to her about it tho, she told me a few things that really got me worried.
On the one hand, she feels understood by him. She feels like herself around him and like she doesn't have to fake her happiness.
On the other hand, she admitted to sending him nudes, as he told her I'd be okay to send some from time to time and it could even be there 'hot little secret'

Needless to say, I'm really worried now. I gave her the advice to stay away from him/stop contact with him and also came to an agreement, that her and I would look for a psychologist at the same time (so niether of us feels like a crazy person needing psychiatric help lol)

Still, I'll continue to try and help her. I already thought about asking her how she feels (although it is incredibly hard for her to open up about her feelings), but also motivating her to go out or try something new or something.

Just fyi: I never met her personally, she lives about two hours away. We do talk (jokingly) about meeting up some time soon tho, so maybe I'll see her soon.

Do you have some more advice on how I could help her? Even if its just a small thing, any help is greatly appreciated!",1,heyy found good online friend mine suffers depression feeling initally asked advice regarding crush already relationship talking tho told thing really got worried one hand feel understood feel like around like fake happiness hand admitted sending nude told okay send time time could even hot little secret needle say really worried gave advice stay away stop contact also came agreement would look psychologist time niether u feel like crazy person needing psychiatric help lol still continue try help already thought asking feel although incredibly hard open feeling also motivating go try something new something fyi never met personally life two hour away talk jokingly meeting time soon tho maybe see soon advice could help even small thing help greatly appreciated,heyy found good online friend mine suffers depression feeling initally asked advice regarding crush already relationship talking tho told thing really got worried one hand feel understood feel like around like fake happiness hand admitted sending nude told okay send time time could even hot little secret needle say really worried gave advice stay away stop contact also came agreement would look psychologist time niether u feel like crazy person needing psychiatric help lol still continue try help already thought asking feel although incredibly hard open feeling also motivating go try something new something fyi never met personally life two hour away talk jokingly meeting time soon tho maybe see soon advice could help even small thing help greatly appreciated
"I (30F) have been struggling with getting my hair washed. It gets greasy a couple of days after washing it thoroughly so I end up just pulling it back in a ponytail most days to have some sort of professionalism for work.

I don't like the way my hair looks or feels when it's greasy. It also becomes an issue whereby my sweat gets all greasy and then my eyes start stinging.

When I get home from work it is the last thing on my mind until suddenly I am too tired and it is too late to have a shower without messing up my sleep. I am thankful that I have a husband who cooks for me or I'd probably never get that done either. I have been pretty lax on my side of the housework too, so he ends up picking up after me.

The feeling I get after a shower is nice, but I have never been someone who can just spend 5 minutes in the shower. I tend to spend about half an hour there because I kind of zone out under the hot water.

I'm also bad at getting up in the morning (I have improved on this somewhat by creating a sunrise lamp from a smart bulb), so getting up earlier to have a shower is a no go for me.

I've tried just dunking my head under a tap every evening before getting into  bed in the hopes that the grease will wash away without the need for the thorough wash, but that didn't seem to work as the grease needs to be washed out fully. I think I just need more positive motivation to do it but I can't figure out what that would be.",1,30f struggling getting hair washed get greasy couple day washing thoroughly end pulling back ponytail day sort professionalism work like way hair look feel greasy also becomes issue whereby sweat get greasy eye start stinging get home work last thing mind suddenly tired late shower without messing sleep thankful husband cook probably never get done either pretty lax side housework end picking feeling get shower nice never someone spend 5 minute shower tend spend half hour kind zone hot water also bad getting morning improved somewhat creating sunrise lamp smart bulb getting earlier shower go tried dunking head tap every evening getting bed hope grease wash away without need thorough wash seem work grease need washed fully think need positive motivation figure would,30f struggling getting hair washed get greasy couple day washing thoroughly end pulling back ponytail day sort professionalism work like way hair look feel greasy also becomes issue whereby sweat get greasy eye start stinging get home work last thing mind suddenly tired late shower without messing sleep thankful husband cook probably never get done either pretty lax side housework end picking feeling get shower nice never someone spend 5 minute shower tend spend half hour kind zone hot water also bad getting morning improved somewhat creating sunrise lamp smart bulb getting earlier shower go tried dunking head tap every evening getting bed hope grease wash away without need thorough wash seem work grease need washed fully think need positive motivation figure would

"as soon as ppl find a boyfriend or get married they just never socialize with you again. it’s always a total 180. never get back to your messages, never reach out, no more hangouts, if they come they have to bring their awkward weird boyfriends and their attention is on them… it’s so pathetic, you can’t go anywhere as an individual?

it’s so sad to me. my mom explained that most people are just focused on finding a partner. once they secure the partner they’re not interested in anyone or anything else.

that’s so depressing. all my friends are going to leave me. so many are already so distanced from me.

i literally have nobody to go to things like comic con with bc the friends i’d have that would go…… they just go with their boyfriends. it’s so frustrating. how are you satisfied with just ONE person literally ALL the time, 24/7? 

what happened to hanging out with friends? all the diversity of personality and learning new things and meeting new and interesting people?

every friend i have just feels like i have a time limit until they find a boyfriend. 

i miss when life was just about friends and now that i’m graduated from college literally nobody talks to me or reaches out to me bc apparently having a boyfriend means rescinding all other aspects of your life that doesn’t involve him.

i’m always going to be alone now. i never got to have friends and when i did it was so short lived . i think it’s so unfair that life works this way. how can people just abandon their friends? their interests? a whole sector of their life?

how are you going to turn your back on your siblings and abandon everything you believed in just bc your husband said otherwise? what is this nonsense?",1,soon ppl find boyfriend get married never socialize always total 180 never get back message never reach hangout come bring awkward weird boyfriend attention pathetic go anywhere individual sad mom explained people focused finding partner secure partner interested anyone anything else depressing friend going leave many already distanced literally nobody go thing like comic con bc friend would go go boyfriend frustrating satisfied one person literally time 24 7 happened hanging friend diversity personality learning new thing meeting new interesting people every friend feel like time limit find boyfriend miss life wa friend graduated college literally nobody talk reach bc apparently boyfriend mean rescinding aspect life involve always going alone never got friend wa short lived think unfair life work way people abandon friend interest whole sector life going turn back sibling abandon everything believed bc husband said otherwise nonsense,soon ppl find boyfriend get married never socialize always total 180 never get back message never reach hangout come bring awkward weird boyfriend attention pathetic go anywhere individual sad mom explained people focused finding partner secure partner interested anyone anything else depressing friend going leave many already distanced literally nobody go thing like comic con bc friend would go go boyfriend frustrating satisfied one person literally time 24 7 happened hanging friend diversity personality learning new thing meeting new interesting people every friend feel like time limit find boyfriend miss life wa friend graduated college literally nobody talk reach bc apparently boyfriend mean rescinding aspect life involve always going alone never got friend wa short lived think unfair life work way people abandon friend interest whole sector life going turn back sibling abandon everything believed bc husband said otherwise nonsense

"A bit of context: I live alone in a family apartment and had a couple bad years which seriously detoriorated my lifestyle. Suddenly all my passion was lost, or having manic/delusional thoughts of chasing dreams. I don't cook as much anymore, I started to stop cleaning and be responsible... 

But recently I had enough and tried to swing things around.  

So let's start with the good: 
- I have gotten a better job with better pay and work life balance. 
- Starting off the day is something I look forward to nowadays. 
-I recently felt more positive and try to make ways to make my life better. 

But... My apartment is a mess. I dread coming back to find more mess despite how much I clean whether due to a spot which I just ignore or my balcony which I never clean at all... 

What's more I'm losing sleep due to finding pest (i.e. dead roach, spiders), I have searched the entire place and still nothing but it's basically like opening up my version of Pandora's box. 

Having this dawned on me.. I am having all these bad thoughts coming back to me.. and I am just really afraid of this affecting this new positive turn in my life. 

I want to take charge, it's my bloody life. But i don't know what to do anymore!!!  I hate myself and my old self for putting me into this situation. I don't know whether to cry or to just give up.

 I don't want my positive turn in life to be affected by this.

"I know this isn't a new concept or whatever, but is just something that has really stuck in my brain today. My mental health has been so low again, and has made me feel that I will probably still be struggling for quite a while..

But while it might not be in the cards for me to be happy right now, I can at least use my existence to help others to NOT feel the same way. That I can spend my time giving encouragement and support, sending kind messages, doing nice things to give my loved ones an easier day. If I can make someone feel good for even a single moment, then my existence at that moment has had some value, and the world becomes that tiniest bit lighter. Something more than me ruminating on my sadness and feeling frustrated that I am not improving.

I hope this resonates with someone, but really I just want to post this to remind myself that all of this can mean something. ❤",1,know new concept whatever something ha really stuck brain today mental health ha low ha made feel probably still struggling quite might card happy right least use existence help others feel way spend time giving encouragement support sending kind message nice thing give loved one easier day make someone feel good even single moment existence moment ha value world becomes tiniest bit lighter something ruminating sadness feeling frustrated improving hope resonates someone really want post remind mean something,know new concept whatever something ha really stuck brain today mental health ha low ha made feel probably still struggling quite might card happy right least use existence help others feel way spend time giving encouragement support sending kind message nice thing give loved one easier day make someone feel good even single moment existence moment ha value world becomes tiniest bit lighter something ruminating sadness feeling frustrated improving hope resonates someone really want post remind mean something
"As the title says, I am failing everything and I want to die.

I’m in a awkward place in my life rn. I moved abroad to try and escape my depression but that hasn’t worked. Back in my home country (UK) I had a shitty job, virtually no friends and no future prospects because of a lack of education. Before then I did really well in school, but dropped out with no qualifications because of depression. The main trigger was that I got rejected by my dream university. My whole life I had been depressed and I thought that if I worked hard I could go to my dream university and things will be better. That was my only hope. So when I got rejected my world crumbled.

I tried taking the qualifications a year after dropping out and failed all but one because of depression… I tried applying to a universities that didn’t require those qualifications (art school) but got rejected again… 
During this time i was working in a dead end supermarket job. I had no friends there and the pay was terrible so my life felt meaningless. I decided after the last university rejection that I would use my limited savings to go study abroad as the requirements are basically to just have the money to pay the tuition fees. I got in so I quit my job and moved to a different continent. And now that I am here i am failing again. I didn’t expect to need to study as much as we have to. In all honesty I just wanted a laid back course to do so I could have fun exploring the country. I underestimated how much time the course would need. I don’t live I student accomadation so I am completely isolated. I don’t have any native friends so I don’t get any practice using the language. These things make me depressed, which makes me lost the motivation to study or even attend class. Now I’ve fallen behind so much that I feel to ashamed/embarrassed to attend class. I don’t want my lack of skills to draw attention to myself. As I child I got severely bullied so now as an adult I fear being ostracised by others for any reason. Speaking of which, this fear has led me to hide who I am in a sense. I pretend to be someone I’m not to fit in with the few “friends” I have here but I feel sad because I know I can’t be honest abou the struggles I am having. My adhd means I find it hard to focus in class or when studying alone and it means that I can’t organise myself. I haven’t told the school because of these stigma here and because my school doesn’t seem to have any support available to international students. 
I don’t want to go back home to the UK because I really hate it hear but I can’t cope with having to repeat the semester because I know I’ll be the only one. I only have enough money for 2 semesters so I’ll feel sad and ashamed that I only learnt one semesters worth of the local language when I go back home. I really don’t know what to do. I have no one to go to for help. I feel really sad and I hate my life so much because I’m such a failure. I wish that I could kill myself to end the suffering but I’m too much of a coward :(",1,title say failing everything want die awkward place life rn moved abroad try escape depression worked back home country uk shitty job virtually friend future prospect lack education really well school dropped qualification depression main trigger wa got rejected dream university whole life depressed thought worked hard could go dream university thing better wa hope got rejected world crumbled tried taking qualification year dropping failed one depression tried applying university require qualification art school got rejected time wa working dead end supermarket job friend pay wa terrible life felt meaningless decided last university rejection would use limited saving go study abroad requirement basically money pay tuition fee got quit job moved different continent failing expect need study much honesty wanted laid back course could fun exploring country underestimated much time course would need live student accomadation completely isolated native friend get practice using language thing make depressed make lost motivation study even attend class fallen behind much feel ashamed embarrassed attend class want lack skill draw attention child got severely bullied adult fear ostracised others reason speaking fear ha led hide sense pretend someone fit friend feel sad know honest abou struggle adhd mean find hard focus class studying alone mean organise told school stigma school seem support available international student want go back home uk really hate hear cope repeat semester know one enough money 2 semester feel sad ashamed learnt one semester worth local language go back home really know one go help feel really sad hate life much failure wish could kill end suffering much coward,title say failing everything want die awkward place life rn moved abroad try escape depression worked back home country uk shitty job virtually friend future prospect lack education really well school dropped qualification depression main trigger wa got rejected dream university whole life depressed thought worked hard could go dream university thing better wa hope got rejected world crumbled tried taking qualification year dropping failed one depression tried applying university require qualification art school got rejected time wa working dead end supermarket job friend pay wa terrible life felt meaningless decided last university rejection would use limited saving go study abroad requirement basically money pay tuition fee got quit job moved different continent failing expect need study much honesty wanted laid back course could fun exploring country underestimated much time course would need live student accomadation completely isolated native friend get practice using language thing make depressed make lost motivation study even attend class fallen behind much feel ashamed embarrassed attend class want lack skill draw attention child got severely bullied adult fear ostracised others reason speaking fear ha led hide sense pretend someone fit friend feel sad know honest abou struggle adhd mean find hard focus class studying alone mean organise told school stigma school seem support available international student want go back home uk really hate hear cope repeat semester know one enough money 2 semester feel sad ashamed learnt one semester worth local language go back home really know one go help feel really sad hate life much failure wish could kill end suffering much coward

I am an engineering graduate student and I have half a year to finish my thesis. I need coding. But unfortunately, I have been depressed? Or have psychological problems for several months. 

The problem is that when I am coding, I can feel hard to breathe. Sometimes when I face bugs in program I even have stomachaches or heartaches. 

I couldn’t focus on my thesis and it makes me slow in progress so I got warning on academics that I could probably be quitter from degree.

"I started taking Prozac in late 2018, was on it for several months, went off of it for most of the rest of 2019 and then on it again since 2020. My psychiatrist is insistent that Prozac is self-tapering and I shouldn’t have to taper off the 20mg daily dose I was taking but, two weeks after stopping, I’m getting major brain fog and it’s getting more difficult to string sentences together (not impossible, I just feel way less sharp in realtime conversation).

"(sorry for my English, not English speaker)

A friend asked me to send him a bike by a postal service. I was already with a lot of things in my head, i knew I had to wrap the bike, but couldnt find much cardboard.

When I got to the place there was this dude that attended the postal service that i know from the start that just wanted to take advantage of me as people of low life/class usually do around here.

I already was at a defensive state, and then he invented some extra fee for wrapping the bike. I knew what was going on. I played the fool and as i was too tired to get more cardboard, or wrap it, or have any trouble, i paid that illegal extra fee.

But i felt really taken advantage of, and this guy also waved a knife around, so i would get intimidated. I was already intimidated just by being next to this low class douche that could get around with any shit he pulls, and i knew that for him i was just the next victim.

(funny thing is that i try to not react bad to low class people, so they don't ger offended, but now I'm thinking this interaction was already spoiled by this low life thug, as the bad vibe i fell was all his act to take advantage of me).

But i think that given all the options (I knew everything that was going on), i handled him the fee and this extra fee... But of course now I feel really bad, i hate imagining this dude celebrating that he scammed another dude with this shit.

I was afraid that if i did otherwise this low class people would damage the bike or something like that... And the sad thing is that they may do that either way. But at the moment i was also afraid of the bike safety.

I felt it was a burden to react and just complain, but now i felt this blame, i felt like a coward that succumb to this low class guy intimidation, and this guy taken advantage of me.

When something like this happen i always say next time i don't even care if everything goes to hell. But then this happens i take this ""solutions"" but the regretted as i feel as a coward or a fool.

It would ease my mind if I could find other cases or how to deal with this kind of situation where you feel helpless.",1,sorry english english speaker friend asked send bike postal service wa already lot thing head knew wrap bike couldnt find much cardboard got place wa dude attended postal service know start wanted take advantage people low life class usually around already wa defensive state invented extra fee wrapping bike knew wa going played fool wa tired get cardboard wrap trouble paid illegal extra fee felt really taken advantage guy also waved knife around would get intimidated wa already intimidated next low class douche could get around shit pull knew wa next victim funny thing try react bad low class people ger offended thinking interaction wa already spoiled low life thug bad vibe fell wa act take advantage think given option knew everything wa going handled fee extra fee course feel really bad hate imagining dude celebrating scammed another dude shit wa afraid otherwise low class people would damage bike something like sad thing may either way moment wa also afraid bike safety felt wa burden react complain felt blame felt like coward succumb low class guy intimidation guy taken advantage something like happen always say next time even care everything go hell happens take solution regretted feel coward fool would ease mind could find case deal kind situation feel helpless,sorry english english speaker friend asked send bike postal service wa already lot thing head knew wrap bike couldnt find much cardboard got place wa dude attended postal service know start wanted take advantage people low life class usually around already wa defensive state invented extra fee wrapping bike knew wa going played fool wa tired get cardboard wrap trouble paid illegal extra fee felt really taken advantage guy also waved knife around would get intimidated wa already intimidated next low class douche could get around shit pull knew wa next victim funny thing try react bad low class people ger offended thinking interaction wa already spoiled low life thug bad vibe fell wa act take advantage think given option knew everything wa going handled fee extra fee course feel really bad hate imagining dude celebrating scammed another dude shit wa afraid otherwise low class people would damage bike something like sad thing may either way moment wa also afraid bike safety felt wa burden react complain felt blame felt like coward succumb low class guy intimidation guy taken advantage something like happen always say next time even care everything go hell happens take solution regretted feel coward fool would ease mind could find case deal kind situation feel helpless

"There was an amazing thread on /r/AskReddit this morning about what are some giveaway signs that somebody is depressed / it's ""too late"".

Social withdrawal came up quite a bit.

The picture seems pretty similar for most of us: nobody wants to foist their problems upon their friends so we push people away more out of consideration than anything else . Depression also makes you kind of retreat into yourself and feel like you're unworthy of social attention / too boring for anybody to bother with. Although oddly, and equally, if there's a single time we can benefit from company more it's when we're depressed.

Overall I think it's a kind of tragic facet of this: we push people away who feel snubbed and offended when we're basically just trying to be considerate and not use them as our unpaid therapists! 

The saddest part: many reported that they neve quite clawed back those relationships after they got well. 

This all seems very sad to me. Beyond working on becoming less depressed, what are ways we can avoid burning valued bridges when we don't particularly feel like talking to friends?",1,wa amazing thread r askreddit morning giveaway sign somebody depressed late social withdrawal came quite bit picture seems pretty similar u nobody want foist problem upon friend push people away consideration anything else depression also make kind retreat feel like unworthy social attention boring anybody bother although oddly equally single time benefit company depressed overall think kind tragic facet push people away feel snubbed offended basically trying considerate use unpaid therapist saddest part many reported neve quite clawed back relationship got well seems sad beyond working becoming le depressed way avoid burning valued bridge particularly feel like talking friend,wa amazing thread r askreddit morning giveaway sign somebody depressed late social withdrawal came quite bit picture seems pretty similar u nobody want foist problem upon friend push people away consideration anything else depression also make kind retreat feel like unworthy social attention boring anybody bother although oddly equally single time benefit company depressed overall think kind tragic facet push people away feel snubbed offended basically trying considerate use unpaid therapist saddest part many reported neve quite clawed back relationship got well seems sad beyond working becoming le depressed way avoid burning valued bridge particularly feel like talking friend

"For the longest time I have had the issue of feeling like a subhuman or a tool meant to have specific purposes, I have been struggling for the longest time with trying to accept I'm a person too and deserve to be treated as such, that I'm deserving of love, or to stop putting the needs of others before mine.

I fear that I'll be exposed as a subhuman and be further alienated from others if I can't keep up the façade and I don't have the time or energy to move elsewhere again to start anew for the nth time.

"I had graduated from my bachelor's degree last year, and haven't been doing much since other than working part time jobs. Everyone around me are urging me to either pick up a full time job or continue my studies.

The problem is that every option out there seems no more appealing than everything else, and I don't know what I want to do at all. I know I should decide on something soon as a responsible adult, but depression made me lose the will to live, let alone work on an academic or career path.

I've been depressed for years and have always passively wanted to stop living. Somehow I managed to survive until now with professional help and family/social support, but every influential choices in life(e.g. uni major) were made rather carelessly while I was a depressed mess. I am scared to randomly pick something and roll with it again while wanting to die every now and then.

I've been considering the option of studying abroad for a change in environment, as political situation and social atmosphere of where I'm from (Hong Kong) are quite shitty and depressing at the moment. Would it be a bad idea to leave all my support network for a new environment? Frankly I'm scared to do that, and the absence of interest in anything doesn't help.

Ever since I’ve gone to college, I haven’t felt anything other than shit and depressed. Before college I never had a friend or a girlfriend and I wanted a new clean slate in college thinking maybe it would be different. I was depressed before college. At the beginning of the semester I went out with a girl I met at a coffee shop and I really was happy. After two dates she said we should just be friends and I couldn’t deal with the rejection, I was devastated. I started putting all my energy into chasing girls and I’ve felt just really depressed. I asked out so many girls in classes, clubs, dining halls, gyms, you name it. There would be some girls that showed signs of interest in me, but it turns out they don’t like me at all. At the dining hall I would look for attractive girls just so I can ask them out and I was such a creep and I feel guilty about it. There was this one girl in my tennis club who I thought was into me because she offered to walk me back to my dorm, laughed at things, etc. But she left me on read two times. I feel like I ruined my reputation in college and will be known as the guy who always asks out the girls. I really do try to change my behavior and I admit I have a problem. I try to concentrate my mind with other stuff like lifting and running, but I’m always reminded that I’m alone. I see attractive girls all of the time on campus and I get so depressed and seeing guys having fun with girls. I also try to make friends with guys, but I’m always the one trying to take initiative. I feel like an outcast. I like my college but I’m considering transferring just because I ruined myself. I can’t ask my family for support because they are already going through some stuff and I don’t want to make it worse. A lot of times I wish I didn’t exist.",1,ever since gone college felt anything shit depressed college never friend girlfriend wanted new clean slate college thinking maybe would different wa depressed college beginning semester went girl met coffee shop really wa happy two date said friend deal rejection wa devastated started putting energy chasing girl felt really depressed asked many girl class club dining hall gym name would girl showed sign interest turn like dining hall would look attractive girl ask wa creep feel guilty wa one girl tennis club thought wa offered walk back dorm laughed thing etc left read two time feel like ruined reputation college known guy always asks girl really try change behavior admit problem try concentrate mind stuff like lifting running always reminded alone see attractive girl time campus get depressed seeing guy fun girl also try make friend guy always one trying take initiative feel like outcast like college considering transferring ruined ask family support already going stuff want make worse lot time wish exist,ever since gone college felt anything shit depressed college never friend girlfriend wanted new clean slate college thinking maybe would different wa depressed college beginning semester went girl met coffee shop really wa happy two date said friend deal rejection wa devastated started putting energy chasing girl felt really depressed asked many girl class club dining hall gym name would girl showed sign interest turn like dining hall would look attractive girl ask wa creep feel guilty wa one girl tennis club thought wa offered walk back dorm laughed thing etc left read two time feel like ruined reputation college known guy always asks girl really try change behavior admit problem try concentrate mind stuff like lifting running always reminded alone see attractive girl time campus get depressed seeing guy fun girl also try make friend guy always one trying take initiative feel like outcast like college considering transferring ruined ask family support already going stuff want make worse lot time wish exist

"my own sibling just greatly dislikes who i am and ignores everything i say and do. it's gotten out of control recently. she's been making me repeat myself and is either pretending she doesn't hear me  or paying so little attention that she just presses my ""repeat"" button and i repeat what I said. it's interfering with daily functioning. when i just leave when she doesn't respond bc i don't have the time to wait around and repeat myself all over, she gets mad.

she always gets what i'm saying totally wrong, even going so far as to telling people we both know things about me that are untrue, like, ""she thought you were pretentious"" when what i said was, ""i don't know if i'll be smart enough for her."" or ""you said you're too good for coding bootcamps"" when in reality i said, ""i don't know if a bootcamp meets my goals right now.""

when i tell her that's not what i said, she ignores me and insists that that is really what i said. that it's all the same. she has a lot of extreme frustration over this belief that i ""care a lot about what each and every individual word means"" when i actually am just tired of being seen as someone i'm not. i don't know how to explain that language matters.

she acts like i think too much of myself when in reality i don't know anything, like everything i say is b.s. (she has literally said this), like i grew up rich (i grew up poor with the rest of the family), like i never lived in the city with them (i was born there, we lived there for the same amount of years). it's like i'm a fraction of a person to her and so many things she says reflects that.

my own friend recently absolutely blew up on me just for not responding to her messages. she knows i'm depressed and dealing with things. and she never responds to me. she always ignores my messages but talks for hours to her boyfriend. literally messaging me ""hi! when are you going to text me back?"" it's so entitled. i'm not obligated to respond to anyone ever. i didn't think messages mattered. she waited for me to tweet that i was upset over this (i tweet these things for my own personal need to vent and just say that i'm disappointed and sad with life) and took it as an opportunity to say that i'm painting myself as ""the victim"" and that this is the real reason she ended the friendship. i'm so confused. i can never acknowledge i'm upset over something without being accused of being a victim.

everyone's gonna say ""find different friends"", well i'm out of college now so i have no opportunity to make them anymore. everyone's just obsessed with their boyfriends or husbands now and don't care about anyone or anything else in the world.

or that i should cut that sibling out of my life because she obviously has zero respect for me and quite frankly, acts like i don't exist a lot of the time. well, i'm sad here because it's my own family. how can someone hate me this much? i thought we were supposed to accept each other the way we are. so what if i'm a fan of anime or korean music? why does this mean that i'm a horrible person? it's beyond her own insecurities. it's these deep rooted beliefs about how i am. she forces those beliefs on me and does anything to frame the way i live around those beliefs. when i challenge those beliefs she actually goes insane. she thinks she knows everything and has settled on the way she thinks i am.

i don't even have a therapist. the one i have just doesn't take anything i say seriously. don't have time to look for another one

i don't know what to do. it's a genuine problem that i can't understand. i understand not everyone clicking with me and being my best friend but do so many people have to hate me? am i really that bad? i'm not mean to anyone, i don't think i hold any prejudices, i'm extraverted, i dress nice, i shower, i speak normally i believe, i don't even have any sort of regional accent, i don't talk over ppl, i don't say my opinions all the time. but almost everywhere i go, there's someone who just absolutely hates me at first glance. it's so depressing and sad.

"I’ve never been treated nicely by anyone. Even the kids that are more rejected by other kids are mean to me. I’ve never been mean to a single person in my life but i get treated like shit constantly. I don’t know why but when I was a kid I imagined the world was a place full of empathy but literally every single person I’ve met has been an unempathetic piece of shit. 

I’m in a friend group that’s so toxic it led one of the kids in our friend group to a suicide attempt with a gun but it ended up missing his brain (I imagine he got scaredd and moved it at the last second). And even AFTER he attempted and was in the hospital they continued to treat him like shit and told him he should’ve just gone through with it. Don’t worry, they also treat me like shit, I’m in a similar position to him and I can’t leave because I have no other friends. Not only that, but I treat the guy that attempted suicide with absolute kindness, I’ve never been mean to him which you’d expect him to be thankful for right? Nope, he actually treats me like shit more than the other kids and he even fought me a month ago simply because he hates me that much.

And it’s not like I have a bad personality, I’m extremely funny in groups of people, like it’s not uncommon for me to have people tearing up cause they laugh so much, but everyone still hates me and treats me like dirt. 

I’m not exaggerating here, but when I imagine the world outside my bedroom I genuinely imagine darkness and madness everywhere. Imagine nightmare on elm street dreams where every house is empty or whatever and it’s always night outside and there’s just a feeling of terror. Also every person I talk to feels fake, conversation is impossible. I genuinely feel like I’m living in a make believe world at this point I’m scared as shit.",1,never treated nicely anyone even kid rejected kid mean never mean single person life get treated like shit constantly know wa kid imagined world wa place full empathy literally every single person met ha unempathetic piece shit friend group toxic led one kid friend group suicide attempt gun ended missing brain imagine got scaredd moved last second even attempted wa hospital continued treat like shit told gone worry also treat like shit similar position leave friend treat guy attempted suicide absolute kindness never mean expect thankful right nope actually treat like shit kid even fought month ago simply hate much like bad personality extremely funny group people like uncommon people tearing cause laugh much everyone still hate treat like dirt exaggerating imagine world outside bedroom genuinely imagine darkness madness everywhere imagine nightmare elm street dream every house empty whatever always night outside feeling terror also every person talk feel fake conversation impossible genuinely feel like living make believe world point scared shit,never treated nicely anyone even kid rejected kid mean never mean single person life get treated like shit constantly know wa kid imagined world wa place full empathy literally every single person met ha unempathetic piece shit friend group toxic led one kid friend group suicide attempt gun ended missing brain imagine got scaredd moved last second even attempted wa hospital continued treat like shit told gone worry also treat like shit similar position leave friend treat guy attempted suicide absolute kindness never mean expect thankful right nope actually treat like shit kid even fought month ago simply hate much like bad personality extremely funny group people like uncommon people tearing cause laugh much everyone still hate treat like dirt exaggerating imagine world outside bedroom genuinely imagine darkness madness everywhere imagine nightmare elm street dream every house empty whatever always night outside feeling terror also every person talk feel fake conversation impossible genuinely feel like living make believe world point scared shit
"**What Is Somatic Experiencing?**

Somatic Experiencing is a specific type of somatic psychotherapy that helps practitioners treat both psychological and physical symptoms in people who have experienced some form of trauma. Premised on the idea that trauma can cause dysfunction within the nervous system and prevent people from fully processing their experiences, Somatic Experiencing was created to help people recognize the connections between their bodily sensations and mental health concerns and then process their distressing or painful experiences.

Various practitioners, including psychotherapists, physical therapists, medical doctors, and others who have undergone specialized training and certification, use Somatic Experiencing to help people heal from trauma by focusing holistically on their *proprioceptive*, *kinesthetic*, and *interoceptive* experiences, instead of prioritizing only their emotional or cognitive responses. Proprioception and kinesthesia are very similar; proprioception is the inherent sense of the positioning of one’s body and the strength needed for a movement, whereas kinesthesia is the awareness of the body’s position as told through sensory organs, such as the eyes. Interoception is the ability to access and feel bodily sensations.  
 

## What Conditions Are Commonly Treated by Somatic Experiencing?

Although Somatic Experiencing was developed to treat PTSD, it is also commonly used to treat depression and anxiety. It can be used to address both psychological and physical conditions and symptoms such as the following:

* PTSD
* depression
* anxiety
* substance abuse
* digestive issues
* sleep problems
* chronic pain
* stress
* autoimmune disease
* eating disorders
* identity exploration

J,

Been doing a lot of reflecting past month. I know you mentioned we talked more than most of your friends - that it was okay if we didn’t talk for a few days. I get that… but now I feel some days full on ignore me.  I know you have been busy with life and work. Sorry if my mental health ever impeded on that. Texting you, “today was a rough day again”, or “I’m not myself”. I remember you said once when are your self?

I frequently never asked you how YOU were doing. Always was me me me.  I had to have been exhausting. Popping up at your office longer than you would have liked when I had to drop stuff off. You were just trying to work.

I spent the last few weeks working on to repair any friendships I may have broken along the way. The “thank you, j’s”  that you mentioned went out the door because I never listened. Working hard as heck on myself. Still consider you an extremely close friend, a brother to me. I respect you, and your patience to this day - nonstop helping me get here with advice that you too had experienced, until your cousin gave it to you straight. 

If you feel it would be better off if we part off as not friends - I understand. I’ll miss you but will remember the countless things you have taught me along the way from not giving a fuck, golf, law, dating - the list could go on. 

Love you brother - S",1,name removed privacy j lot reflecting past month know mentioned talked friend wa okay talk day get feel day full ignore know busy life work sorry mental health ever impeded texting today wa rough day remember said self frequently never asked always wa exhausting popping office longer would liked drop stuff trying work spent last week working repair friendship may broken along way thank j mentioned went door never listened working hard heck still consider extremely close friend brother respect patience day nonstop helping get advice experienced cousin gave straight feel would better part friend understand miss remember countless thing taught along way giving fuck golf law dating list could go love brother,name removed privacy j lot reflecting past month know mentioned talked friend wa okay talk day get feel day full ignore know busy life work sorry mental health ever impeded texting today wa rough day remember said self frequently never asked always wa exhausting popping office longer would liked drop stuff trying work spent last week working repair friendship may broken along way thank j mentioned went door never listened working hard heck still consider extremely close friend brother respect patience day nonstop helping get advice experienced cousin gave straight feel would better part friend understand miss remember countless thing taught along way giving fuck golf law dating list could go love brother

I'm really not sure where to start and I am pretty positive that I'm gonna sound like I'm feeling sorry for myself and and seeking attention but honestly I just don't feel like there's one single thing in my life that is worth fighting for anymore. (PLEASE DON'T FREAK OUT BECAUSE I SWEAR I'M NOT GOING TO HARM MYSELF I JUST NEED TO EXPRESS THE SEVERITY OF MY SITUATION) I am a single 48 year old female that is living in a area that makes me miserable and hopeless all on it's very own my children are all grown adults and I literally have not one single person in the world that I can even have a casual conversation with. I live in an apartment that I never leave until it's practically a life or death situation that I can't postpone or put off another single second or it's just gonna make my life even more stressful and miserable. I hardly ever eat anything anymore and I go for weeks at a time without any kind of human contact or interaction of even the smallest amount. The area that I live in (north Alabama) is full of absolutely nobody besides thieves and junkies that the only thing they are any use for is to scheme and plot out whatever they have to do in order to steal everything that other people who have worked hard to get the things that they have earned the right to have through hard work and determination. ( Yes I have had my apartment robbed multiple times and I know exactly who has done it but the police refuse to do a damn thing about it because they claim that there's no proof of who actually committed the break in) That brings me to the rest of my situation and why I have nothing in my life that is worth continuing to fight to live for and it's so hard to keep fighting to survive without any kind thing that has a great enough value in my life that I believe I should keep going just so I can continue living in complete pain and depression and without a single person who even cares if I live or die because the absolute only reason that I would even be missed by a single person would be because the bills don't get paid on time and people come wanting their money and if that wasn't the case I probably wouldn't ever be missed or found at all. I'm sinking deeper and deeper into a dark and hopelessness that I am terrified that I will never be strong enough or have enough willpower or reason to even try to continue to even try to not give up on everything anymore. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm being a baby about this but it is really getting me down to the point where I have even lost myself and can't remember who I was and what I loved so much about the woman I was that I always kept fighting and struggling to keep moving forward but now I don't even recognize the face that is looking back at me when I look in the mirror anymore and it honestly is more than a little bit frightening and it makes me realize that I don't even have myself to fight to continue loving because she's long gone and I don't even remember who she was anymore. If something doesn't change for the positive very extremely soon I am gonna have no other option but to have myself committed to the hospital until I get better somehow. Please if you don't mind please pray for me and my situation I've hit rock bottom and I don't even have the ability to pray for myself it's so bad.

"Hello all, I’m a 20 something year old male. I’ve had anxiety, depression and adhd most of if not my whole life. Honestly looking back on it, I thought a lot of this stuff was normal and did not get help expect for my adhd (hyper child, easy to pick up on) until later in life. I took some weak medication for anxiety and depression and got through college. Now I’m working part time as a social worker. Once I started working, I noticed my anxiety spike up, so I started seeing a therapist regularly and seeing my psychiatrist regularly to calm my anxiety attacks. This started back in March. I think I feel a bit better. Anxiety is still there, but now my depression is in full swing. I wake up, not being able to go back to sleep, but not wanting to get out of bed. Once I do get out, I get a weird feeling in my upper stomach or lower chest, like right above the belly button. This feeling doesn’t go away until night time when I can talk to my friends. I’ve upped my medication and it’s suppose to start working soon, and I’m doing what I can in therapy, doing work outs 5 days out of the week, but I’m still depressed. Maybe I don’t like my work, maybe I want something more? But it’s difficult doing this every week. I enjoy being with my friends but then my brain is like “you only got this much time left with them”. I’m trying cbt methods but dang it doesn’t feeling like it is working. It feels like a piece of the puzzle is missing, and I’m not sure what it is.

We have all tried to be there for them as much as we can, but they seem afraid to bother us with their problems, despite us trying to make it clear we will always be there to listen and that we value and love them. When we attempt to reach out, they tend to try to deflect any attempts to speak about an issue further, saying that its not worth talking about or they didn't want to turn the focus to them. When we do talk about things, we seem to move in circles, like there is something they just can't quite get across to us, this leaves them frustrated, and it seems as though what is said isn't helping. We all intend to remain available to them whenever they need us, but we all live far away from each other, and there is only so much support we can give them online. Lately, we have found ourselves at a loss, we have tried to encourage them to seek medical help, and to move away from a toxic family situation where they feel undervalued, but after an initial interest, they seem to fall back into thinking they can do nothing about these issues, that they just have to tough them out until they can go to school. They seem to have set going back to school as their goal, and aren't willing to change their current situation for the better if it means setting it off for even a few more months. Moving out of their toxic family situation, or taking some time away from work, temporarily reducing their hours, etc. We worry that this could lead to them having a harder time with school, with such little time to recover.  Our support doesn't seem to be enough, and we want to do more, so my question is: What more, if anything can we do for them? We love them dearly and it hurts to see them this way, we will always remain available to them no matter what. We want them to be happy and enjoy the time they spend with us, because we are happy and enjoy the time we spend with them.",1,friend online really sweet person group love much unfortunely suffer severe depression suffer severe lack self confidence low self worth see nuisance bother speak tried much seem afraid bother u problem despite u trying make clear always listen value love attempt reach tend try deflect attempt speak issue saying worth talking want turn focus talk thing seem move circle like something quite get across u leaf frustrated seems though said helping intend remain available whenever need u live far away much support give online lately found loss tried encourage seek medical help move away toxic family situation feel undervalued initial interest seem fall back thinking nothing issue tough go school seem set going back school goal willing change current situation better mean setting even month moving toxic family situation taking time away work temporarily reducing hour etc worry could lead harder time school little time recover support seem enough want question anything love dearly hurt see way always remain available matter want happy enjoy time spend u happy enjoy time spend,friend online really sweet person group love much unfortunely suffer severe depression suffer severe lack self confidence low self worth see nuisance bother speak tried much seem afraid bother u problem despite u trying make clear always listen value love attempt reach tend try deflect attempt speak issue saying worth talking want turn focus talk thing seem move circle like something quite get across u leaf frustrated seems though said helping intend remain available whenever need u live far away much support give online lately found loss tried encourage seek medical help move away toxic family situation feel undervalued initial interest seem fall back thinking nothing issue tough go school seem set going back school goal willing change current situation better mean setting even month moving toxic family situation taking time away work temporarily reducing hour etc worry could lead harder time school little time recover support seem enough want question anything love dearly hurt see way always remain available matter want happy enjoy time spend u happy enjoy time spend
"I think I've given up, just when I feel that my mom cares about me and tries to help me and understand me, I am betrayed once again. How can I take opening up to her and showing my pain when it's made fun of behind my back? When something that hurt me very deeply ( I don't want to talk about it, but it has to do with physical abuse) was made into a light joke that she thought I didn't hear? I don't even want to cry or feel angry anymore because what is the point, I know deeply they will never truly love me. 

Even slight remarks that are negative trigger me so much and make me very upset and she gets mad at me for that and makes fun of me. It's really hard to stop being triggered so fast when I feel so unloved. A small thing would be that someone made a comment about me that guys would want a more beautiful person to be with than me. That comment was made to my mom and she was telling me like it was a joke, I asked her what did she respond and she acted like it wasn't anything of a big deal and she didn't remember what she said. I got angry and upset ( I feel like if I had a child I would never allow anyone to say anything about them). I've been told by my parents ever since I was little about how fat I was (looking back I wasn't so big, I just had a different, curvier body shape). When I would lose weight, the response was ""oh you lost weight, but you need to keep going and lose some more"". 

Anyway those are just some of the small things that were said about me. I just don't get why all the hatred was towards me only and not my other siblings. They could literally do extremely bad behaviors and there was never any type of anger or punishment, it was moreso ""oh he never came home on time from school because he was somewhere he wasnt supposed to be and the police was called because they were so worried so let's get him a cell phone so he can let us know where he is"". He was younger than me and I was over there having to go to the office to make phone calls or ask friends if I can borrow their phone. 

Or the numerous silent treatments I have been given over fights of me constantly being blamed or guilted. None of her other kids were ever given the silent treatment. That's how my mother and father treated each other, how else would I know how to deal with my emotions. I mean when I used to get into fights and then later on if my brother got into fights with my parents, guess whose fault it was that their son was behaving like that, me, not the parents who didn't raise a single child with any form of emotional wellbeing. I can't even remember the number of times I was blamed for so much, if I didn't help them with their schoolwork, if they behaved a certain way. but I was struggling by myself to figure out how to do the college application process (not even a ""i know i don't know much about this, but is there anything I can help you with or let me try to learn this so I can help my child). But when it came to their son's applications, magically they knew how to read through things or learn about the process and then force me to help! Then the college I went to wasn't good enough apparently. I don't even want to bring up finances where my dad wanted to hold on to every single dollar he had and watch me struggle and suffer trying to figure out how to pay. Or that during college, when I would do like a blue collared job like working in retail to pay for college, he would say that that's all I would amount to ( I didn't even have a degree yet but I guess I was supposed to have a high paying job at that time). Or how after I graduated I was working entry level position and it wasn't the best pay but my job wasn't good enough either because I guess I was supposed to be paid senior level pay). Now he wants to say that he has helped me so much in my life, paid for my college education, and he worked so hard for my success. 

Anyway, those are just some small things, there was a lot I had to deal with growing up. I guess now I know that in this verbally and sometimes physically abusive family, me, the child was apparently the support system to a grown mother, emotionally supporting her, and even helping her with things that dad wouldn't when he should have, to the point as I had gotten older I was involved in ""what did your dad say, show me what your dad did, go find this out from your dad"". Where I had to be the one to protect my siblings from their fights. In the end I was still betrayed over and over again by my mother, telling my secrets I told her to my father, siding with him if there were arguments between us, in the end choosing her other children over me. I don't know how many times I can be betrayed to think that I am loved to then just get rejected once again.

But I guess I'm the bad person for having emotional problems and they are great parents and they don't get why there's anything wrong with me or why there should be any issues. I should've just gotten over those things. Those are not big deals and why would those affect me so much, they are in the past right? I guess I should not be hurt when I am already depressed and expressed my feelings to my self on paper about my body, job, life, unhappiness and that paper was then taken and read and shown to my siblings to laugh at me. I guess the mind should not be affected by past events. The worst is when I'm told that all these thoughts of how I was treated and the unfair treatment is all in my head, meds should help me fix my issue (nobody else is the problem) so that those thoughts go away instead of ever acknowledging my feelings or apologizing.

I wrote way too much and rambled, but I need to really give up any hope or chance that they will love or care about me. I need to never cry again when I think about how hurt I have been, or made fun of, laughed at, talked about behind my back, betrayed. Just help me so that I feel no emotion around them, I would just rather answer and talk to them robotically. I have had stopped talking to them for a full year and then a year on and off. I don't think they learned a single thing, the second I started talking again, it was BACK to the same things they talked about with me before. I just want to be completely cold, I don't want to have any kind of laughter or fun with them and I would rather be like this everywhere I go (because for some stupid reason, when I'm out with others or even with coworkers, I'm between trying and genuinely being nice and happy. Sometimes I feel like I'm people pleasing, sometimes I feel like I'm being so fake and so sick of that and sometimes I feel like I'm genuinely happy). But I don't want to let anyone in because one way or another they will somehow hurt and betray me, talk about me behind my back. I would prefer to be cordial. When I think about my family talk about me behind my back it hurts and is so painful but when I have these thoughts that other people are talking negatively about me (even if they are not), I start getting anxiety, heart racing, feel like throwing up (for everyone to not like me makes me so uncomfortable and stressed out). So I would rather engage a small amount, surface level conversations and never delve into any emotions, feelings or personal issues. I just need to learn how to do that as well as lose all my feelings about my past and engage in emotionless talk with family.",1,think given feel mom care try help understand betrayed take opening

I'm laying on my new mattress crying right now and struggling to breathe. I called someone who I trust to talk but she was not interested. One word monotone responses followed by silence. I did manage to do a little schoolwork today too.

"Growing up, my parents put a lot of pressure on me to perform well in school. My mum is intense. She works as a lead manager in a global company managing hospital IT systems. She is very organised and constantly pushes to get better results. Her attitude towards her workplace carried into life at home. I was only young and became very stressed out about school. I wanted to be a filmmaker or a chef as those are my two burning passions. I chose IT to keep my parents happy and it was the worst decision I ever made. 

I still remember the day, I chose my subjects, my mum was on the phone to me and she came across as angry and agressive. I can understand she wanted me to make the right decision ASAP, so I had an idea of what to do with my life. It seems although back then it was always just money and working and if you weren't the best or master at something then there was no point in doing it. She also bought a local food business since I was interested in cheffing and I began working in that at age 12. It drove her mad as it wasn't performing as well as it should have. I hated that and when I reflect my fondest memories as a child were watching films, especially with my German grandparents. We watched Werner Herzog and old war classics, my grandpa was in the army so he loved War films. 

I hate school and all those times my mum would have lose it with me. I will admit, she was right too, i gave up with school when I was 14. I had no friends, I spent so much time studying and burnt out. I also gained a lot of weight and didn't go outside. I didn't know any better. I was just left to my own devices and I chose unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with the stress and the hole I was digging. I thought this was all life had to offer and that I was trapped. I never even self harmed or tried to kill myself as my parents were clear that they ""did not approve of that"". I never spoke up because it would have made my parents even more angry. I just didn't speak anymore.

Its 5 years later and I'm 19. I have only began to come out of my shell and become the person I want to be. I write films and I am working as a freelance photographer. I also manage an ice cream shop and I fucking love life. I'm defintely not where I want to be right now but I know where I'm heading. I love all the beauty and illusions in life. I love talking to new people and listening to their outlooks on topics, it interests me so much and I always learn something new. I still live with my parents and I have spoken up about my feelings at times. My parents have calmed down I suppose even though not much has changed with their careers. They are still very orgainized and controlling about things but they don't put as much pressure on me. I still feel a lot of resentment but I am working on it. I want to move on and escape the pit I created.

"Hi everybody!

So  my girlfriend has had a severe depression for a year now. We barely  speak (living in different cities) and she also stopped talking to any  of her friends. Pretty much the only people she communicates with are  the ones she meets in online games.

I  was thinking about asking her friends to make short clips with some  simple wishes, that I could compile into one video for a birthday  surprise. But I’m not even sure that’s a good idea. Some time ago I was  regularly sending her uplifting messages about what an incredible person  she is, etc.; and she basically asked me to stop. Her reasoning was  that the messages were putting more pressure on her to feel that she  should be ok, when that’s just not the case.

Having  that in mind I don’t know whether getting those videos from her friends  would also put some kind of pressure on her, and do more harm than  good.

Obviously no one can say how  exactly she would react and depression is different for everybody. But  if any of you maybe had a similar experience I would greatly appreciate  your input on whether you think this video thing might be a good idea or  not.

Thank you for reading and hope there can be some light shining in everyone’s life.",1,hi everybody girlfriend ha severe depression year barely speak living different city also stopped talking friend pretty much people communicates one meet online game wa thinking asking friend make short clip simple wish could compile one video birthday surprise even sure good idea time ago wa regularly sending uplifting message incredible person etc basically asked stop reasoning wa message putting pressure feel ok case mind know whether getting video friend would also put kind pressure harm good obviously one say exactly would react depression different everybody maybe similar experience would greatly appreciate input whether think video thing might good idea thank reading hope light shining everyone life,hi everybody girlfriend ha severe depression year barely speak living different city also stopped talking friend pretty much people communicates one meet online game wa thinking asking friend make short clip simple wish could compile one video birthday surprise even sure good idea time ago wa regularly sending uplifting message incredible person etc basically asked stop reasoning wa message putting pressure feel ok case mind know whether getting video friend would also put kind pressure harm good obviously one say exactly would react depression different everybody maybe similar experience would greatly appreciate input whether think video thing might good idea thank reading hope light shining everyone life

"Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days.

I’ve been seriously thinking of killing myself for about four/five months (definitely had suicidal thoughts before that for many many years, but I didn’t start thinking it though or planning anything out until now). I’m starting to finally feel like I’m reaching the end, lol. 

I genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like I’d be lying when I tell them I have “intent” that’s more than just thoughts, although I do have many plans I’m hoping I can go through with when I’ve finally reached my limit (so I’m afraid they won’t admit me anyways). I’m trying to weigh the pros/cons of trying to get myself admitted and so far I’ve only been able to come up with cons:

My worries/concerns:

* I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now.

* I’d also be worrying about what my friends/family are thinking while I’m gone and how I'm just causing them unnecessary stress (it'd be a shock for them as they don't know any of this)

* I’d also be worrying about missing my classes/assignments/a midterm and how I would catch up afterward

* I feel like I’d be generally miserable for however long I’m there

* I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although I feel like I wouldn’t be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again.

I just don’t see that many pro’s in checking myself in, but I don’t really know what else to do. Could anyone who’s gone through the process give some guidance?

Thank you.",1,hi everyone hoping get advice next couple day seriously thinking killing four five month definitely suicidal thought many many year start thinking though planning anything starting finally feel like reaching end lol genuinely believe capacity harm way significantly even slightly kind feel like lying tell intent thought although many plan hoping go finally reached limit afraid admit anyways trying weigh pro con trying get admitted far able come con worry concern idea much stay checking would cost believe worrying would leave lot worse also worrying friend family thinking gone causing unnecessary stress shock know also worrying missing class assignment midterm would catch afterward feel like generally miserable however long think might make miserable enough actually commit suicide leave although feel like able effectively kill would go whole process hospitalization see many pro checking really know else could anyone gone process give guidance thank,hi everyone hoping get advice next couple day seriously thinking killing four five month definitely suicidal thought many many year start thinking though planning anything starting finally feel like reaching end lol genuinely believe capacity harm way significantly even slightly kind feel like lying tell intent thought although many plan hoping go finally reached limit afraid admit anyways trying weigh pro con trying get admitted far able come con worry concern idea much stay checking would cost believe worrying would leave lot worse also worrying friend family thinking gone causing unnecessary stress shock know also worrying missing class assignment midterm would catch afterward feel like generally miserable however long think might make miserable enough actually commit suicide leave although feel like able effectively kill would go whole process hospitalization see many pro checking really know else could anyone gone process give guidance thank
"ive been looking to get a full mental health assessment for a while now. i’m going to provide context, if you would like to skip, it is after the **. 

**  i am 21 right now (it was actually my bday a few days ago). didn’t get help until 2017. i went to a hospital and spoke to a crisis counselor and was diagnosed with MDD and GAD. to clarify, i was there for less than 24 hours. after that i searched for a psychiatrist close in my area to start seeing for further diagnosis and medicine. first lady i went to didn’t want to look further into any of my symptoms and kept giving prozac and upping the dose, some anti depressant used for sleep i think started with a t, and xanax. so i stopped seeing her. it’s hard to find psychiatrists in my area that take my insurance, even my general doctor suggested psychiatrists out of my plan that i couldn’t afford. i got somewhat lucky and found one who does facetime appointments. he’s nicer to talk with, however, hes also like how most psychiatrists are, a bit disconnected (from the patient, i mean). i get adderall from him (which i only take once in a while cause i end up pulling an all nighter if i take it too late, even though they only last 5-6 hours). not diagnosed ADHD officially.   **

i have only been officially diagnosed with GAD and MDD after talking to a crisis counselor once, but i relate to symptoms of ADHD, autism, BPD, and OCD. i don’t think i have all of those, though. psychiatrists that take my insurance are hard to find and the few i have found don’t seem interested in doing a full assessment. i don’t know where to go from here.  i would like a full assessment to know what treatment i need. they’re mostly all on facetime which i feel adds a barrier. 
i have an opportunity to get an MRI to check for temporal lobe seizures. i have heard that mental health disorders can also be found on an MRI, so i wonder if i could ask them to also find that information? although i’m not sure where i would take that information next for further help. 
any resources or advice would be appreciated.

"Im in a really tough battle with myself right now and at this point im just gonna give in.

im a month into college and still have no friends. joined clubs, went to school events, talked to people from class, still nothing

the people i have hung out with are just trying to fuck around with me and use me all over again so im avoiding all contact so i dont have to deal with it

i have family telling me i should give people a chance but they dont deserve it. ive given everyone whos hurt me a chance and they blew it, therefore they dont deserve that much from me

im losing friends from work of 3 years. theyve been ignoring me in our group chat and havent really spoken to me. it makes me sad yet im not too upset about it. i always felt anxious around them but we still had our good moments. i went on a trip with them and everything. it hurts that im now being ignored yet its my own fault for not ever being present so im getting whats coming i guess

because of this i decided that im taking half of my classes on zoom next semester. not only do i not wanna see or deal with people but i want to see myself get worse. its all i really deserve plus i love feeling pain. i also get to stay in the comfort of my bedroom and stay to myself all day which would be beautiful.

im looking forward to the continued loneliness and getting even more depressed than ive ever been before. people dont give a shit about me regardless and i dont do much at school anyway so zoom it is.

frankly i dont care how dangerous it is for my mental health at this point. i hate everyone and i hate dealing with fakeness. so fuck everyone and everything, up to my bedroom it is

still dont know what im doing with my life either and still mourn the fact that im out of high school. i continue to lose things around me so at this point idk whats left",1,im really tough battle right point im gonna give im month college still friend joined club went school event talked people class still nothing people hung trying fuck around use im avoiding contact dont deal family telling give people chance dont deserve ive given everyone hurt chance blew therefore dont deserve much im losing friend work 3 year theyve ignoring group chat havent really spoken make sad yet im upset always felt anxious around still good moment went trip everything hurt im ignored yet fault ever present im getting whats coming guess decided im taking half class zoom next semester wanna see deal people want see get worse really deserve plus love feeling pain also get stay comfort bedroom stay day would beautiful im looking forward continued loneliness getting even depressed ive ever people dont give shit regardless dont much school anyway zoom frankly dont care dangerous mental health point hate everyone hate dealing fakeness fuck everyone everything bedroom still dont know im life either still mourn fact im high school continue lose thing around point idk whats left,im really tough battle right point im gonna give im month college still friend joined club went school event talked people class still nothing people hung trying fuck around use im avoiding contact dont deal family telling give people chance dont deserve ive given everyone hurt chance blew therefore dont deserve much im losing friend work 3 year theyve ignoring group chat havent really spoken make sad yet im upset always felt anxious around still good moment went trip everything hurt im ignored yet fault ever present im getting whats coming guess decided im taking half class zoom next semester wanna see deal people want see get worse really deserve plus love feeling pain also get stay comfort bedroom stay day would beautiful im looking forward continued loneliness getting even depressed ive ever people dont give shit regardless dont much school anyway zoom frankly dont care dangerous mental health point hate everyone hate dealing fakeness fuck everyone everything bedroom still dont know im life either still mourn fact im high school continue lose thing around point idk whats left

"I came off of medication about five months ago, did wonderfully for four months. I started to have some self esteem issues and feel bad about myself for a bit bit I figured that was just me refocusing on the feelings that I had about myself before taking meds. I went home to visit family across the country and it sent me into a depression and anxiety spiral. 

I have an appointment to possibly go back on my meds next Friday, but in the mean time I can’t sleep at night. My body starts to relax and then as soon as I start to slip into falling asleep I lose it. Either that or I go from being really tired to just being awake.

"Hello, I would like some advice on how to deal with this issue that I've been having for a while that got worse this year.

It is affecting my life negatively and yet I can't do anything about it. I can't seem to care about anything, I do my best to focus on my school work and on helping my siblings with their school work but if I do sleep through the day and end up not being able to help I just feel empty.

"Hey. I'm not very experienced with Reddit, but I figured it would be a good place to write down some thoughts, and if anyone happens to have some advice, that would be a nice bonus. 

I've been struggling a lot with school over the past five-ish years. I've had no real issues with grades, outside of some minor decline during online school. I struggle more with the sense that I'm an outsider in the environment. I'll explain this a little bit more later on, but here's a bit more background: 

(sorry if I jump all over the place)

I'm currently a Junior in High School. It seems like every year I start to feel depressed and it doesn't stop until I start piecing myself back together in the summer. The issue is, every year the state of depression seems to come a little earlier. I don't really know when it started last year, but it was rough. This was the first time I really started to consider suicide. The main issue, however, is that the depression clung on throughout the summer. I was certainly doing better than when I was in school, but I couldn't completely shake the bastard. That makes this the first school year I've gone in to depressed.

Now I should explain more about why school is so awful for me. It's difficult for me to relate to other people at my school. I feel like there's no one that I share interests (things I used to enjoy) or values with. I'm generally not very interested in anything social, especially when it seems like no one sees things from the same perspective I do. School feels more isolating than time I actually spend alone.

I can't stand the monotony. Every day is filled with lectures on subjects I can't see value in. I hate having to sit at a desk for 8 hours straight listening to someone talk about something neither of us cares about. Then I get assigned some work to keep me busy at home and prevent me from spending my time doing things I enjoy (or used to at least). Every day feels the same: dull, unimportant, and so mentally draining that I find myself drifting off, thinking about all the different objects in the room I could use to kill myself.

By the time I get home I feel so tired and empty that I have no will to do anything requiring any ounce of work. I feel like I'm drowning and every day after school and every weekend is a short breath of air that allows me to cling on for just a little longer. Unfortunately, I'm using more oxygen than I can draw from these brief gasps for it. Every week my brain and body are a little bit more dulled. 

The thing is, even if I manage to simply ""tough out"" these last two years, I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I expect to be offered a full ride to any college in my state, but I don't intend on going. I cannot conceive a reality in which I make it through college without sticking a gun in my mouth. I think I'll need a job with constant action or I'll get bored. If you've read this far and know of any that I wouldn't need a degree for let me know! I expect I'll end up enlisting. It's not exactly a bright prospect, but I think terrorists would be less likely to kill me in the Middle East than myself in a college dorm or a cubicle.

I can't fall asleep right now, but I'm really tired, so I'm sure this post looks like the ravings of a madman.  Sorry if it made no sense whatsoever. 

I should probably mention I'm meeting a psychiatrist or pyschologist soon. I don't remember which it is or when ""soon"" is, but I hope that is productive. I think they're going to screen me for ADHD. My regular doctor doesn't think I have it because I do well on tests, but the diagnostic criteria looks pretty relatable to me. I'm not sure if I ever actually was diagnosed with depression, but I've seen my doctor quite a few times and in those visits it was basically assumed that I had it. She put me on Prozac for a while, but I didn't notice any changes. I also tried coaching for a bit last year, it was great in the short term, but not a full fix.

TL;DR: School makes me depressed and it gets worse every year. I'm surprised I survived the last one. I have no hope for the future. I'm probably neurodivergent in some way outside of the depression. The drugs my doctor gave me for depression didn't help. Coaching didn't really help either.",1,hey experienced reddit figured would good place write thought anyone happens advice would nice bonus struggling lot school past five ish year real issue grade

"But my partner (or ex, not sure anymore) stopped me.  I hate him for it. I feel like a coward.

My job is full-time and I don’t want to quit or take time off in fear of losing my insurance and subsequently my meds. But I feel I have to keep working because I have no choice. And my work has exhausted me to the point of burning out and looking for a new job, even though I feel I have no transferable skills. 
For most of my life I’ve had dreams I wanted to accomplish, of wanting to do more but over time I’ve settled, setting the bar lower for myself because I thought I wasn’t good enough.

"Hi, I just made a reddit account for the sake of this alone. I'm 19 M and I feel the worst I have ever felt in life. I try to find a psychologist and I am overwhelmed with ads and shit and don't know where to start. I don't know how to find one. I am in college and have 0 friends at a huge university and I have basically nothing I care about. I genuinely feel like if I was in a prison I'd be better off. Please if any of you guys know how to find a good psychologist let me know asap, you will save me. To be clear though, I'm not suicidal or anything like that, I've just been on a downward spiral and I need help to get out of it. Anyone that can help, I will be so thankful for, and I truly mean that, I've never been so miserable. Basically, my issue is I have bad social anxiety, but NOBODY would ever tell because I have really good social skills, so people don't see that in me. The social anxiety has now caught up to me in college because it's prevented me from being able to have a life, whereas in high school I always had close friends and stuff to do. But they all go to different colleges now and I don't see them except when I'm home. Also, I want to just write as a note here at the end, there are definitely people that are even worse off than me. To you guys that have severe depression I want to wish you the absolute best in getting over it and encourage you to find help, because the one thing that I am sure of is there is no way to think yourself out of it alone. I've tried for the past 2 years, and basically all I do is think. You have moments where you feel like you know what you can do or feel like you are good enough to get out of it. But it's a repeating cycle. From what I've experienced, it's like a little weight gets added on your shoulders every day without noticing it, until it compounds over large periods of time and it starts to paralyze you.

"I once posted here a few weeks ago that I was tired of not getting helped and that I wanted medication at least to not go through the most 


I'm really so happy right now. I'm finally getting the help I need. I went to a therapist and got told I have anxiety and borderline depression symptoms. After I had to deal with doctors not believing me and also some family members not believing me, I finally got a doctor who helped me out. He even decreased some of the costs just in case I might not afford the medication.


I'm just finally glad that after nearly a year of going back and forth, I'm getting help.

"Tldr: Paying for life help/ advice/ coach? Services? Company?
I am putting rant but it is a question, it's just long and ranting.
I have had severe depression all my life but I've just kinda dealt with it but have issues with caring enough about myself to live a healthy lifestyle. Before I realized it; I have a addiction to getting high to deal with my anxiety and depression, spend all my time in a daze/ work/ gym/ friends (I only go to the gym cause I pay a personal trainer and roped a friend into it to better myself) I don't take care of my room (haven't had a clear floor in a year) and bathroom though (and I think I have black mold which terrifies me). I'm going to the doctor regularly for drug help and have been trying to get to a therapist. I feel like I need to rent another place, move out, and then tell the owner so we can pay to get it removed (I will happily pay full if need be I like the owner). I feel like I need to live alone so I can hire a maid to help me regularly clean or a life coach to help me. I'm an adult and it pisses me off that i'm this unable. Luckily I work a job I hate that pays well, so I am very willing to figure out paying someone to help me get my life together cause I hate myself. I don't know if these services exist but I wanted to ask here first. I apologize for the long question.

Yes i did feel like i wanted to dissapear at that time but treated it as a joke, and no one seems to vare about me at that time.

"Like the title says, I'm unable to think clearly. It's like the gears in my brain is covered with gunk and is just not moving smoothly. I've been getting decent sleep, but I'm tired regardless of how much sleep I get. Food is not an issue afaik. No alcohol in quite a while and I've reduced how much caffeinated soda or any soda I drink because I was addicted to it. I'm getting decent exercise too. 

But I just can't think well. Or concentrate for that matter. That's the one thing I've got, you know? My brain. Doing innovative things at work is one of the only things I'm proud of and that's letting me down. And I'm fucking nervous all the time. It's like there's something clutching me in my chest 24/7.

"I'm 27, I've come very close to take my own life twice. Depression is a b\*\*\*\*, I think we all know that. However the second time I had the courage to go to the er and ask for help. I thought: fuck my family and friends, somehow they will go through it (yes, I think you know, at some point a big cry for help only feels like burdening more your loved ones), fuck my career, fuck you all. I stepped in and told the nurse I just tried to hang myself.

Best decision of my life. I've been through three weeks of hospitalization, but now I'm recovering. Meds took me back to life. I couldn't even remember what it feels like being...present. What it feels like  really want to do something, have the motivation to do even the smallest things like take the garbage out, or wash the dishes, or have a decent, real meal, or have a talk with your friend...and not feeling like these activities drains you of all your energy.

With family and friends at first it was though. Especially with my mother, she's the kind of ""meds are bad"" person. I'm not even sure she really grasped what has happened. But I've discovered a new allied, my father. My parents are separeted and he wasn't really present when I grew up. He was kinda...messy.  I found he fought depression for a long time. Now they are all really happy to have me back.

Please, please, please, ask for help. If you are reading this you are stronger than you ever think. You are facing hell alone ('cause I know, depression is a very private, personal hell, you can have the most loving family or friends in the world but you wouldn't ""feel"" it) but you are not giving in. Please please please don't give up. Do it for yourself, for your future self who will look back and say ""You know what,  I've been playing rock paper and scissors with death and I'm still here.

"I’ve done a lot of research in psychology the past couple years to figure out how to have better control over my thoughts, and from what I’ve read on meditation and CBT, it sounds to me like all you really need to do to regulate your emotions is to filter out unhelpful thoughts and only listen to helpful ones. To put it another way, you don’t really have control over whether negative thoughts come up or not, but you can just let them pass and ignore them. Is this essentially what they teach you how to do in CBT? If so, it seems rather simple in theory and something you could learn how to do on your own, and I feel like it’s helped me with my depression and anxiety so far.",1,done lot research psychology past couple year figure better control thought read meditation cbt sound like really need regulate emotion filter unhelpful thought listen helpful one put another way really control whether negative thought come let pas ignore essentially teach cbt seems rather simple theory something could learn feel like helped depression anxiety far,done lot research psychology past couple year figure better control thought read meditation cbt sound like really need regulate emotion filter unhelpful thought listen helpful one put another way really control whether negative thought come let pas ignore essentially teach cbt seems rather simple theory something could learn feel like helped depression anxiety far

"Hello everyone. I need some advice. My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) are currently living in China. In China, access to any sort of mental health assistance is not the easiest. He has struggled with depression all his life, due to family trauma and having a very poor relationship with his parents. He has always been told to be strong and keep it together but the cracks are showing and he is struggling to keep it together. We are currently needing to make tough decisions about going back to our home country (where my very loving family is and his manipulative ones are) or stay in China. Staying in China is also not ideal because of numerous other reasons as well as us being away from our home country for nearly 3 years. The time away has taken its toll on us. However, He has no ties back in our home country due to his relationship with his parents and the relationship is only getting worse, making him increasingly angry and hurt.

I just want to know if anyone has advice on how to help someone struggling who has mastered the art of sealing their emotions, who puts on a brave face all the time and who has internalised their trauma. He struggles speaking to a psychologist because speaking about his past is too painful and again, he was never allowed to show emotion and finds the process of therapy more challenging than most.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

"28, male. 

A few days ago I wrote here about my fear of having developed diabetes since my last check-up 2 years ago, even though I had little to no symptoms or major risk factors. I wrote in a way that showed I was conscious it could just be my hypochondria but deep down I didn't rationalize it that well. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating (as if a snack would pump up my blood sugar in case I wasn't diabetic yet), I postponed my moving to the city. You see, I had to go back to my parent's place in my hometown over the pandemic, I was supposed to be here max. a year, but I had a terrible depression that isolated me from the world for months. Now I'm better and I was ready to go back and restart my life and my friends were waiting for me but then this sort of manic episode happened and it all went to shit. I postponed that for a week and I got my lab results today and I'm ok. Better than ok, not even pre-diabetic. I even got tested for cholesterol, triglycerides, and other parameters that didn't really need and only made the test more expensive and it came back perfect. Now I feel terrible, I wonder if that was an excuse for not getting out of my comfort zone. I think my friends are disappointed in me. I've been postponing my return for a month now, they sure think I'm an idiot. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Over the years, my fear of having HIV, hepatitis, cancer, tumors, you name it, have been restraining me from job interviews, meetings, dates, school work, even simple nights out with friends. I feel hopeless, pathetic. I wonder if it’s even worth it to move back to the city to restart my private and professional life if I'll keep on fucking it up. I don't have a life in my hometown, I don't have a future, but at least I don't disappoint anyone but myself.",1,28 male day ago wrote fear developed diabetes since last check 2 year ago even though little symptom major risk factor wrote way showed wa conscious could hypochondria deep rationalize well sleeping eating snack would pump blood sugar case diabetic yet postponed moving city see go back parent place hometown pandemic wa supposed max year terrible depression isolated world month better wa ready go back restart life friend waiting sort manic episode happened went shit postponed week got lab result today ok better ok even pre diabetic even got tested cholesterol triglyceride parameter really need made test expensive came back perfect feel terrible wonder wa excuse getting comfort zone think friend disappointed postponing return month sure think idiot first time something like ha happened year fear hiv hepatitis cancer tumor name restraining job interview meeting date school work even simple night friend feel hopeless pathetic wonder even worth move back city restart private professional life keep fucking life hometown future least disappoint anyone,28 male day ago wrote fear developed diabetes since last check 2 year ago even though little symptom major risk factor wrote way showed wa conscious could hypochondria deep rationalize well sleeping eating snack would pump blood sugar case diabetic yet postponed moving city see go back parent place hometown pandemic wa supposed max year terrible depression isolated world month better wa ready go back restart life friend waiting sort manic episode happened went shit postponed week got lab result today ok better ok even pre diabetic even got tested cholesterol triglyceride parameter really need made test expensive came back perfect feel terrible wonder wa excuse getting comfort zone think friend disappointed postponing return month sure think idiot first time something like ha happened year fear hiv hepatitis cancer tumor name restraining job interview meeting date school work even simple night friend feel hopeless pathetic wonder even worth move back city restart private professional life keep fucking life hometown future least disappoint anyone

"My stepson, 35, has some undiagnosed mental issues along with anxiety and depression. A couple months ago he lost his job because he wasn't showing up to work.

I know he makes a few dollars here and there but I'm not sure how. He never leaves his house and he refuses any help unless my wife just offers to give him cash. We have learned that he has been doing some sort of drugs off and on for several years.

About a year and a half ago we had to spend a lot of money to get his house out of foreclosure because he hadn't been paying the bills. I know he hasn't paid his mortgage in several months so at some point they're going to foreclose on him and kick him out.

I'm just not sure what to do. When he stays with us he argues with his mom Non-Stop if she even asks him to take a shower. He doesn't clean up after himself and when he goes to the bathroom he makes a huge mess. It's hard for me to even think about living with that. He also has a three-year-old child then he refuses to see because he doesn't get along with the mom and he pays no child support.

But if I tell her he can't stay here if he's not working or showering or cleaning up after himself, she just says that she's afraid he'll be homeless or kill himself.

"Hello, so I'm 21 and currently in ""college"", the """" cuz it has been online classes only since the pandemic started.
Before covid I was living in another city and attending college there. But when the pandemic started it wasn't that smart to keep paying rent (without a fixed job, i was free lancer as a waiter in party events) to live in another city, so i briefly moved back with my mother.
I wasn't that good mentally in 2019, so when I come back home ended up seeking a therapist, which was great actually, I haven't felt that good in a while - I started taking antidepressants and regular therapy really helped me with a lot of issues.
So fast forward in the beginning of 2021 I ended up getting a job in my home town, in retail. It helped me pay for therapy, gym membership and I still could save money for when I had to go back to my college's city.
So, it's been a few embarrassing months since I got fired I haven't find a new job. All my savings have been spent and my therapist, that actually has a psychiatrist degree in other contry (that means she can't work as a psychiatrist in my country) has been helping me with meds. She prescribed my currently antidepressant and manage to get me a prescription so I can buy it. 
Now heres the problem, since i lost my job and the prospect of college is looking further and further away, depression got the best of me and I've been pretty down. My mom started some stupid conspiracy theory that my meds are actually what are keeping me depressed and started nagging me and my therapist.
My therapist was helping me while doing something sort of illegal, since she can't act like a psychiatrist in my country, so when my mom started calling her non stop talking about how it was basically her fault I'm like that, she had to step back. My therapist called me and told me she couldn't help me with the meds prescriptions anymore, but she would still be seeing me as a therapist.
So now, I dont have money to see a new psychiatrist, I'm out of antidepressants cold turkey and things are worst than ever. 
I don't know what to do, days are a blur, I only sleep, cant eat anything, barely leave bed, I'm super behind in all my colleges assignments and I dont knows how to find sny strength to idk get a job, pay my bills and just get better, can someone please give a little advice? On idk how to get a little better so I can help myself? It's being though.

Her dad doesn't care much for her and she hasn't seen her mom for 2 years since she lives in Vietnam so I believe she also feels very lonely. She said she's telling me all this because there's nothing I can do about it. I told her to live for her happiness but she told me when will I ever find happiness, you can't promise me happiness either (since we are long distance apart). ""Why should I have to live for other people that love me if I don't care about myself"" this was something I had nothing to say to. She also talked about suicide but told me she was scared of death at the moment. I have no idea what to do or how to encourage her to seek medical help.

"Sorry for the title, but it really is the best way to put it. Everyone says they care about me, want me to live, to message them if I ever feel like doing it. But I've noticed a pattern, those same people talk about me behind my back, those same people often want me alive, but not necessarily around. 

My question is this, am I right to think that people as a whole are a lot more fake and cold than they're willing to admit? Because I see a lot of words being said but I've yet to meet someone who I actually believe cares.

This post may seem self centered but I ask it out of frustration, I try my best to fight through it, for others. To be there for others. To care for others. Yet I struggle to find evidence of reciprocation besides empty words.

The only reason I'm alive today is because I promised I wouldn't hurt those around me by doing it, but I'm feeling like they wouldn't actually care? And I'd appreciate honest answers because I don't want to be alive for people who don't care anyways.",1,sorry title really best way put everyone say care want live message ever feel like noticed pattern people talk behind back people often want alive necessarily around question right think people whole lot fake cold willing admit see lot word said yet meet someone actually believe care post may seem self centered ask frustration try best fight others others care others yet struggle find evidence reciprocation besides empty word reason alive today promised hurt around feeling like actually care appreciate honest answer want alive people care anyways,sorry title really best way put everyone say care want live message ever feel like noticed pattern people talk behind back people often want alive necessarily around question right think people whole lot fake cold willing admit see lot word said yet meet someone actually believe care post may seem self centered ask frustration try best fight others others care others yet struggle find evidence reciprocation besides empty word reason alive today promised hurt around feeling like actually care appreciate honest answer want alive people care anyways

"Hi everyone, I’m really feeling shitty again, I know I post in these subs a lot. I felt better for a few weeks, started new meds and a new job but now I just feel worthless, pathetic, and disgusting again. I just don’t see the point in putting long term effort into things (e.g why would I keep practically starving myself to lose weight when it takes so long and I still end up “fat” to most people). Now I’m stuck in a shitty cycle of binge eating when that never used to be a problem for me, I’m desperate to lose weight and look better yet I let a small setback (like high-calorie food tasting gross) make me think “I fucked up anyway, might as well go all the way”. I’m really depressed again and have tried everything at this point and nothing ever changes. Thank you for reading or any advice, I don’t really know what to do anymore because I try to do the “right” things and never get what other people have (energy/looking better, feeling hopeful/confident, etc).",1,hi everyone really feeling shitty know post sub lot felt better week started new med new job feel worthless pathetic disgusting see point putting long term effort thing e g would keep practically starving lose weight take long still end fat people stuck shitty cycle binge eating never used problem desperate lose weight look better yet let small setback like high calorie food tasting gross make think fucked anyway might well go way really depressed tried everything point nothing ever change thank reading advice really know anymore try right thing never get people energy looking better feeling hopeful confident etc,hi everyone really feeling shitty know post sub lot felt better week started new med new job feel worthless pathetic disgusting see point putting long term effort thing e g would keep practically starving lose weight take long still end fat people stuck shitty cycle binge eating never used problem desperate lose weight look better yet let small setback like high calorie food tasting gross make think fucked anyway might well go way really depressed tried everything point nothing ever change thank reading advice really know anymore try right thing never get people energy looking better feeling hopeful confident etc

"Hello there it is October 6 today and I’m currently on a nice brisk walk at 8:50 PM at night so I just want to talk to you a little bit about purpose and the meaning of life and all that I am recently made this art piece that was speaking about purpose the Japanese word for purpose is ikegai and I find that having some notes her piece of paper somewhere that says Ikegai on it is a really really strong and helpful way to ensure that you remember you’re doing the best You can with what you know right now. 
I find that finding purpose is the purpose of life… We just have to keep our heads up and I’ll persevere through the challenges that life throws our way it’s all about breaking through the Maya which is I believe an Indian word which I recall roughly translates to illusion because we all live under this great illusion we get so wrapped up in our busy little lives that we forget life isn’t happening to us we are consciously choosing to do everything that we have to do we are the ones in control. We are all the Buddha all you have to do to see is to sit with yourself and look in if you look the right way you’ll start to see it clear as a mirrors reflection. Getting back to the point however speaking of purpose the funny part a double bind as I am Alan Watts would say ERM is that you get distracted so much sober life right and that’s actually also a good thing because if you’re the one controlling everything right if you’re aware of that life starts to get really boring it’s the struggles that come into our lives that give us meaning to give us purpose and see what I said then they give us purpose, or ikegai

Without challenges coming into our lives we don’t have anything to help us grow and become stronger when you overcame adversity so heading for all your life though it may be taxing at the same time he must remember that likes a balancing act and do you have a good day must be bad and have bad good Orion short there is no good and bad it’s just life and you know you have to remember to keep a positive attitude about what life throws at you and what you choose to do with what life throws at you it’s all in your control you just got a remember that it’s in your control but at the same timeYou must also remember to let go and just let life happen there’s none in Taoist philosophy there is a term called wu-wei Or effortless action other definitions of it could include doing nothing standing idle so on but just because you are stunning idol doesn’t mean things aren’t happening you’re just letting them happen you’re not doing anything in particular you’re just observing life living in the moment and you know processing the things that are around you in whatever way he feels most natural to you.",1,hello october 6 today currently nice brisk walk 8 50 pm night want talk little bit purpose meaning life recently made art piece wa speaking purpose japanese word purpose ikegai find note piece paper somewhere say ikegai really really strong helpful way ensure remember best know right find finding purpose purpose life keep head persevere challenge life throw way breaking maya believe indian word recall roughly translates illusion live great illusion get wrapped busy little life forget life happening u consciously choosing everything one control buddha see sit look look right way start see clear mirror reflection getting back point however speaking purpose funny part double bind alan watt would say erm get distracted much sober life right actually also good thing one controlling everything right aware life start get really boring struggle come life give u meaning give u purpose see said give u purpose ikegai without challenge coming life anything help u grow become stronger overcame adversity heading life though may taxing time must remember like balancing act good day must bad bad good orion short good bad life know remember keep positive attitude life throw choose life throw control got remember control timeyou must also remember let go let life happen none taoist philosophy term called wu wei effortless action definition could include nothing standing idle stunning idol mean thing happening letting happen anything particular observing life living moment know processing thing around whatever way feel natural,hello october 6 today currently nice brisk walk 8 50 pm night want talk little bit purpose meaning life recently made art piece wa speaking purpose japanese word purpose ikegai find note piece paper somewhere say ikegai really really strong helpful way ensure remember best know right find finding purpose purpose life keep head persevere challenge life throw way breaking maya believe indian word recall roughly translates illusion live great illusion get wrapped busy little life forget life happening u consciously choosing everything one control buddha see sit look look right way start see clear mirror reflection getting back point however speaking purpose funny part double bind alan watt would say erm get distracted much sober life right actually also good thing one controlling everything right aware life start get really boring struggle come life give u meaning give u purpose see said give u purpose ikegai without challenge coming life anything help u grow become stronger overcame adversity heading life though may taxing time must remember like balancing act good day must bad bad good orion short good bad life know remember keep positive attitude life throw choose life throw control got remember control timeyou must also remember let go let life happen none taoist philosophy term called wu wei effortless action definition could include nothing standing idle stunning idol mean thing happening letting happen anything particular observing life living moment know processing thing around whatever way feel natural
"So, I started this new job in August it’s a pretty good job and I’m more than grateful to have it. Around that time, I had quite a big dip in my mental health and started medication. My managers have been very understanding and I told them what was happening. They even put together a structure for me at work. 

I was holding on and doing my best to not take time off work as I wanted to make a good impression and also earn enough to help pay some debt. Lately, I’ve hit another dip and just went to catch up and update my managers and one of them proceeds to tell me that I need to give a heads up when I have appointments.

I understand this from a business perspective but getting appointments is already hard as it and I don’t feel like I can turn down those appointments. It just really upset me because I’m trying so hard to be reliable to them and the job but things change so rapidly sometimes for me and I can’t control that. I feel this immense pressure on me and I’m slowly losing it. 

I left the meeting thinking that they’re probably gonna talk about me after and how they probably think I’m weak because I broke down in front of them. Or maybe they’re gonna fire me because there is someone who can do a better job than me.

Background: been battling depression for about 10 years and severe anxiety for about 5 with various up and down periods. Hit my most difficult time in 2018 when I was suicidal. After 3 years of hard work I was able to hold down a full time job and felt like I was on the right track. I am on several medications and in therapy.

So this year I started working in a new school, had plans to move out on my own and felt really good about everything in the summer. Then I got incredibly anxious about living alone and had some other financial hardships hit and so now I can’t move out. After the 2nd week of school I had my first major panic attack at work (has never happened before) and had to leave.
Ever since then everyday had felt like a battle to get out of bed, go to work, and just keep going. For 3 days a week I work 12-14 hour days (I work 2 jobs) and I’m just so exhausted all the time. I’m scared because I’m starting to fall back into another depressive state, I’m not enjoying life, I don’t have a desire to see friends, play soccer, etc. I have 0 motivation to go to work. (I work as a SpEd teacher aid). I’m also incredibly scared of contracting Covid (fully vaccinated). I don’t know why I’m falling backwards and it feels like I’m failing at life again  

Just needed to get that off my chest",1,female 29 background battling depression 10 year severe anxiety 5 various period hit difficult time 2018 wa suicidal 3 year hard work wa able hold full time job felt like wa right track several medication therapy year started working new school plan move felt really good everything summer got incredibly anxious living alone financial hardship hit move 2nd week school first major panic attack work ha never happened leave ever since everyday felt like battle get bed go work keep going 3 day week work 12 14 hour day work 2 job exhausted time scared starting fall back another depressive state enjoying life desire see friend play soccer etc 0 motivation go work work sped teacher aid also incredibly scared contracting covid fully vaccinated know falling backwards feel like failing life needed get chest,female 29 background battling depression 10 year severe anxiety 5 various period hit difficult time 2018 wa suicidal 3 year hard work wa able hold full time job felt like wa right track several medication therapy year started working new school plan move felt really good everything summer got incredibly anxious living alone financial hardship hit move 2nd week school first major panic attack work ha never happened leave ever since everyday felt like battle get bed go work keep going 3 day week work 12 14 hour day work 2 job exhausted time scared starting fall back another depressive state enjoying life desire see friend play soccer etc 0 motivation go work work sped teacher aid also incredibly scared contracting covid fully vaccinated know falling backwards feel like failing life needed get chest
"So my hate is even getting worse to be honest I just hate my friends and everyone. I regret ever meet them to be honest even tho I don't want to think like this. They did nothing wrong I just have deep hate and it's annoying it repeats in my head and I want to punch something really bad but I hold it back. 

Man I am just completely sad like I really am sad man I don't do shit I like anymore I want to find something to numb the pain and I want to hurt my self with something man just don't know what tho.


All this verbal abuse shit that I still goes on in my life made me think about love completely different then anyone to be honest I will probably not even ask anyone out to be honest just might not even going to try.

Anyone that trys to be nice to me I tend to say thank you but in reality I doubt myself I don't think anyone likes me even my own parents I just don't trust much feelings anymore just does not even matter to me I see it as a joke to be honest.

I am probably going back to my really bad phase of depression I think happen in 9th grade even thought of killing myself even if I go back to that phase I won't kill myself

"So over the past week we have argued over several things that are vastly important to me but seemed to be news to him. Arguments about our possible future and about his loyalty. These arguments lasted hours, and he eventually apologized for everything horrible that he said. But my main point it: Usually when we get into arguments I get so full of negative emotions like despair, anxiety, and tearful rage that I have to scratch my arm until it bleeds or bite a hole into myself to keep from screaming my lungs out, to have a physical pain to override the mental and emotional pain. Before you worry I never show him or let him know that our argument hurt me so bad I had to hurt myself , he has no idea. Well the past week with all the serious big arguments I made it!! I didn’t even THINK about hurting myself once, I just wanted to celebrate because ever since I was 9 every argument and fight I’ve been in ended with me hurting myself and crying in private, and I’m finally getting stronger than that!",1,past week argued several thing vastly important seemed news argument possible future loyalty argument lasted hour eventually apologized everything horrible said main point usually get argument get full negative emotion like despair anxiety tearful rage scratch arm bleeds bite hole keep screaming lung physical pain override mental emotional pain worry never show let know argument hurt bad hurt ha idea well past week serious big argument made even think hurting wanted celebrate ever since wa 9 every argument fight ended hurting cry private finally getting stronger,past week argued several thing vastly important seemed news argument possible future loyalty argument lasted hour eventually apologized everything horrible said main point usually get argument get full negative emotion like despair anxiety tearful rage scratch arm bleeds bite hole keep screaming lung physical pain override mental emotional pain worry never show let know argument hurt bad hurt ha idea well past week serious big argument made even think hurting wanted celebrate ever since wa 9 every argument fight ended hurting cry private finally getting stronger
"From my childhood until my early adult years I have played computer games very consistently. I'm now in college, and have very low motivation. I find myself playing video games instead of studying, or smoking pot. So far I've been able to hold up my grades but I know that this isn't sustainable. When I am not playing games or high I feel bored, but I don't know what else to fill my time with. I'm terrified of the fact that I have no interests or hobbies. I waste my time. I go to class, I come home, I play video games. Maybe I'll take a break and lay down in bed and mindlessly scroll my phone. I haven't consistently felt like this, in high school I did have a small amount of friends but some close friendships even though they were strongly centered around pot. I've moved away for college and find it hard to socialize with new people, but I know it hasn't always been like this because I've had the ability to be funny and go up and talk to people. Now I hardly feel like my brain is capable of creativity, I try and think of something funny and it's like my head is out of juice. I feel a lack of confidence and I'm sick of shit being like this. I find myself talking myself out of commitments for change and rationalizing my way out of things. This has turned into more of a rant at this point and I supposed I just need to stop smoking weed and playing games. I'm just concerned I won't find anything to replace it as I feel like I have no interests. I think getting a job could help me feel better as well, as I was planning on focusing on my studying instead of working and am just using grad money at the moment.

"Hello, I'm a 16 year old guy from southern Italy. I've decided to post here because I'm in a terrible psychological state recently and I need some help, and you people from Reddit are probably the only ones who can help me right now.

I've recently found out I'm bisexual. I mean, I'm not entirely sure, all I know is that thinking about sex with males (as well as females) turns me on. But I'm not romantically interested in men, I don't think I could love one, it would disgust me. I've NEVER had a crush on a guy (but on lots of girls), and really can't see myself having one.
I already asked on another subreddit for sexual orientation help and they just told me that I'm bisexual, so I guess I'll just use this definition.

Now, the fact that I'm bisexual is a problem for me. I live in a very conservative family and they don't tolerate LGBTQ+ stuff at all (especially my father). My friends probably are as well, because they tend to make jokes on gay people etc. That's why I haven't told anyone yet.

I'm a very anxious and overthinking person. The smallest problem is torture for me. The fact that I'm bisexual has brought me several tremendous thoughts that just continue being in my mind and giving me a constant feeling of depression, anxiety, guiltiness, and generally not enjoying life or anything at all.

1) As I've said, I've grown in a very conservative family, so I am myself homophobic. I'm dealing with LOTS of internalized homophobia, and I keep hating on myself because of my bisexuality. Every time I feel happy, I have this terrible feeling of guilt that makes me sad again, something like ""no, you don't deserve this, you little sh**"".

2) Fear of being hated and/or insulted by others if they knew this part of me. I feel like my parents and friends are loving a fake version of me, and that if they knew that I was bi, they wouldn't love me anymore, and I would therefore be alone, which scares me a lot.

3) As I said, I really like girls. I really want one. Before I found out that I was bi, everytime I was sad, I imagined receiving love from an imaginary girlfriend. I know this sounds very odd and insane -- but the thought that in the future, I will someday find a loving girlfriend, that understands me and cuddles me and makes all my horrible thoughts go away, made me feel better and happy. 

Now I don't have this ""tool"" anymore. Everytime I get sad and think about this, it now makes me feel worse, because I'm afraid that because of my bisexuality, I will never find a partner. Because, let's admit it, little to no girls like men who are attracted to men as well. And even if you told me that it isn't true, that lots of girls nowadays aren't homophobic and wouldn't actually mind having a bi boyfriend, there's still a very consistent chunk of women that do NOT like that.

I'm a very shy person, I've never been engaged before, I sometimes even have trouble talking to my close friends, just imagine my chances of finding a partner. They were already very small before, now they're even smaller, because even if I ever find one, there's a very high chance that she would leave me if she found out about my bisexuality.
Because yeah, I really think I should tell my partner at some point. I don't think I could hide this from my gf, I would probably live with constant anxiety of her not wanting me if she knew.
 
And when should I tell her? At the very beginning of our love story? Or after a while? I feel like the longer I wait, the worse it would be. What if we date for a year, I get really attached to her and then I tell her and she leaves me? I would probably die inside. Like A LOT. It's the worst of my nightmares. I often get anxiety because I'm extremely scared that this might happen in the future and that I might be *alone for the rest of my life*, not even getting the chance to know what cuddling with a girl feels like. Because, god dammit, I just need somebody to love me, I can't live without the feeling of being loved by someone.

4) I need to jerk off to both genders. There are periods where I like to satisfy myself to females, and ones where I feel the need to satisfy myself to males. They both alternate and are overally balanced in frequency. I'm trying to reduce any kind of porn that I watch, especially gay which I'm trying to cut off entirely. Everytime I jerk off to males, I feel very guilty until I jerk off to females again.

This is a problem itself, but what's worse is that I had this thought recently: what if I find a partner, she accepts me as a bisexual, but I still need to jerk off to males while we are in a relationship? Would that be okay? I wouldn't tell her, of course, she doesn't need to know what I jerk off to just as I don't have to know what she jerks off to.
But, all I'm asking is - would that be ok from a moral perspective? I have a feeling it is not, and imagining this is giving me anxiety. I hope the need to masturbate goes away with age and I can be satisfied just by the sex with her, so I won't have that problem. 


I'm sorry I wrote this much. But I feel like I'm going insane. I really needed to take it all out somehow. I hope somebody is able to give me some nice thoughts to make me feel better and remove the bad ones. I cannot take this anymore.",1,hello 16 year old guy southern italy decided post terrible psychological state recently need help people reddit probably one help right recently found bisexual mean

"I am making a decision by tomorrow on if I should return the cat. Hey! I have a friend who recommended for me to come here so I could get some input from all of you awesome people. This is not something I would discuss in person.  I adopted a cat from a young lady about 2 months ago. I received an email 3 days ago asking for the cat back and a 5 page certified letter with 30 pictures in the envelope today asking for the cat back with a detailed list of terms and conditions at the back of the sheet which talked about litigation rights and such. In that same envelope was proof of three veterinarians they have visited, rabies vaccine, microchip information and adoption papers from a shelter. They had resources and references for verifying his information, phone numbers to every therapist/psychiatrist, and a link to a lawyer's office that is close to where I live. 

She says that the reason she gave the cat up at first was because she was going through tons of mental health problems, domestic abuse that made her feel like she had to rehome the cat, and that she has just been diagnose with ADHD in addition to having autism. She tells me that she found help, got medication and is not living in an apartment from domestic abuse. I don't know much about autism and ADHD but they sure don't seem like they have those conditions since they also work as a licensed pharmacy technician at a job near their town. 

She even sent me the letter she had for when she made the cat an emotional support animal and psychological evaluations that mention the cat in the paperwork. I did sign a contract but I did not sign my name, only printed my name even though the contract said it is similar to a signature. She went as far as saying she hasn't eaten in 2 days and has been having stomach aches. We have already become kind of attached to the cat, and so has my son who is homeschooled. I want to know what is ethically right to do. But I recognize this person had the cat for 3 years. Is it wrong to not give the cat back or could there be more trouble down the road especially since I am a Christian?

They said that they could not imagine a world without having this cat back in their life.  Then why wait so long to contact me back in the first place. I ignored the first email. They did seem well written. I feel like I want to write an angry email back because autism should not be an excuse to make such a poor choice. And my house is bigger for the cat than an apartment, so is it fair? Maybe I am being too harsh and I can find another cat. I am sure by the way they are talking that they would go to the end of the earth and through anything to get this cat from me.

"Hi, I've been on two medications for a short time. Clomipramine for my depression and Methylphenidate (commonly known as ritalin) for ADHD. While I have noticed and upturn in my general mood, it seems to drop throughout the day at regular times. Before 10am, I'm actually quite good and productive. By 11, I can feel a real drop in my mood. By 1pm I'm completely gone and miserable for the rest of the day.

Basically I'm just wondering if others have experienced this kind of mood drop when put on meds. I feel it must be a positive in the sense that I have a decent mood in the morning but I hate how quick it drops off. Any tips? I've told my doctor and I'm not after real medical advice.

"I’m so depressed it’s not even funny. I don’t have any motivation to do my school work. I can’t afford school and they might kick me out soon since I owe a lot. I don’t know if I really care. I was already feeling like a loser for only being in school for an associates degree but I had to because I couldn’t afford the bachelors program. Now I might not even get to finish my associates. School is limiting how much money I make at work. Not having my own car is also limiting how much money I could be making. I can’t get a car because I’m not making enough money. I don’t take care of myself  in terms of hair care, skin care, and overall health of my body any more. Then the way I look makes me even more depressed.

"Does anyone else just get weird feelings of situational claustrophobia?   Like The feeling of just being stuck no matter what you do?    When this happens to me I get really anxious, have trouble breathing/feeling choked, and get really scared.   

I’ve just keep getting knocked on my butt by life and just almost feel cursed.  

I lost my Mom two years ago.  I lost our dog in June (which has just upended my world), hit back to semi-functionality and I had a gas leak, cost money to fix that, but back to functional, and I blew a tire on the way to work.   So now I’m really stuck at home.  They are trying to order my tire, and it’s taking forever to get.     I thought I’d try to rent a car for a couple of days, but there are literally none available due to car shortage.  

It’s just like every time I try to take a positive step, I suffer yet another setback.  
And I know some of that is “just life” but it sure feels like life is out to get me. 

And every time it does i get really down, beat myself up, and get these weird feelings I mentioned earlier. 

Is this “normal” within depression?   I just really feel like something is wrong with me personally.

"Hello, I really need help. For the past few years I have been depressed just not want to exist. In the last 2 years it's been really bad. I have had suicidal thoughts an had 2 attempts. I also think I have social anxiety for the past year of covid-19. My depression stems from my father who has always used cruel and abusive punishments for me for very small things.  He expects me to be perfect at everything I ever do. I can not remember a single time he said I did good or he was proud of me. He does not care for my mental health or general health only that I did something perfectly. My anxiety stems from the fact that I don't have time interact with outer kids. It's been a year since I talked to someone my age. I'm now being forced to go to a new physical school were I don't know anyone. I can't interact with people like I used to. For the past year I have been suicidal and a voice in my head  constantly said ""why would anyone miss you?"" And the ""world is a better place without a waist like you."".
I also have no support network, my school counselor refusese to talk to me and I'm only 13 so what can I do. I don't really have friends. My father also thinks men can't cry and if I do he will beat me. I just want to die, it's not like my life matters there are 8 billion other people on earth.

"22M…. Literally nothing feels good. 

I spend my day solving tediously difficult problems with little resources and poor instructions. Hours of frustration. 

Eating is just another chore that doesn’t bring any joy, unless I eat bullshitjj foods in which case again it will make me feel even worse than the little pleasure it brought me. 

Masturbating is basically a desperation attempt for something to feel good but honestly its just lack luster, there is no real desire. And if I watch porn it will feel good, but I don’t because porn will make me feel even worse after. 

There is no emotional support from anyone, no one cares about a young mans feelings. 

Finishing at the gym makes me feel a little good, but its fucking exhausting and the energy and effort I put into it feels as shitty if not more so than the little dopamine I get after. 

I think this is where my problems with women come in. I want them badly, because sex with women feels awesome. Having a woman around is validating and feels awesome. Cuddling feels awesome. It feels like a woman is the only thing that can bring good feeling into my life without having an immediate and often worse downside. And I know this is problematic thinking.

There is this thing about me that has been guilting me for a long time ...
It is that  , I am not doing anything 
I am studying (if finishing notes , paying attention in classes counts as ""studying""), talking to people (though I have started to talk about myself more and more , I don't know if it feels good or not but it is fine , but I do feel horrible for doing so , and even now , it is more of me just listening and caring about other's problems more than mine )

Everyone has their own forest which they take care of ,and it has been freaking me out cause in my forest , there is nothing that I want ... It is everything that other people wanted me to have 
And even when I know this , I am doing nothing  for working it out and not working on my skills and just sitting here looking at life go by way to fast for me hold on and I feel like
I am going to a be a failure because I am not working like others or like I want to work ...

When I say work I mean it includes studying and my things like drawing (for my career) and reading (which has become a very very scary feat for me now )
And if I stay like this ...
I will be a failure 

I know things change , but only when I make the change or so do something for that change to happen  
I am not doing anything ! 
Not for myself or for others ! 
I am failing at everything 
How dose one get out of this ? 

I wish I was an maniac ...at least this way...I would do things and work on my skills and be good at things .....
I just wish I wasn't me anymore ...

"I’m seeking advice since I have no idea where to turn to. Any help on which resources which might best help  would be greatly appreciated. 

My mother passed away last November and I’ve been struggling even more with my depression since then. I lost my previous career that was practically my life, broke up with an abusive ex, faced eviction, am struggling with alcoholism and am now on the verge of losing my recent job due to attendance issues. 

I currently do not receive health insurance nor can I afford any treatment at the moment so I can’t go to a doctor or medical professional for an official diagnosis of depression to provide to any employers. (I had gone years ago when I did have health insurance but I don’t think that diagnosis would stand now) 

I’ve also been really wanting to go to rehab, but again can’t afford it. (Any resources or pointers in the right direction on this would also be greatly appreciated). 

Ive been told to apply for unemployment if I’m fired again but i don’t think I’ll qualify since I’ve barely worked at this new job for a month, have missed multiple days or gone home early, and couldn’t receive any accommodations without a diagnosis.

I’m just desperate at this point for any advice on what I might be able do so im not left quite literally homeless. Or if anyone might be able to point me in the right direction to something that might help. I will most likely keep applying to jobs but I just don’t think I have the capability to handle any type of work tasks, I can barely make it out of bed in the morning.

I tried researching this but I could only find a bunch of inspirational tidbits or little self care practices that you can only do with a comfortable and well paying full time job. Which again, is not the reality of the situation. 

Any advice would help!

"For starters: my friend and I have been friends through the internet for over a year now but we've gotten close as time progressed. She's German and I'm American. TW: suicide


My close friend has been dealing with depression for years now. Even before meeting her. She's been in and out of depressive episodes for the past couple of months. I've been there for her to support, help as much as I can, and to listen to her ever since we've known each other. I always reminded her that she matters and been on her side. I know that sometimes my intentions to help her could not be seen as ""helpful"" in a sense. The reason is that I'm not patient enough with her, especially when she says that she needs time for herself. I wait for like an hour or so to proceed to text her about how she's doing to the point that I'm insistent with her. (Yes, it doesn't seem helpful at all). Lately she expressed suicidal thoughts, and she also expressed that she wanted to be distant from me. The reason she wanted to be away from me because I'm too amazing for her and I shouldn't be with a depressed and hopeless girl like her. I'm deeply concerned for her. I listened to her and attempt to understand her feelings. She told me that she wanted time to be alone, and I was scared that she was going to do something reckless or attempt suicide. Then I proceeded to spam call her and text her. She said that I was stressing her out, and that she really needed time for herself. Then approximately an hour later I gave her a call to check up on her but she declined. Then I texted her my concerns. She then replied that I was being selfish and that I don't accept her need for having time for herself. Then when she texted goodnight, she expressed how I need to accept her ""leave me alone"" as I forced her. Does she mean that when she wants to be alone is like a boundary being set up? Is it possible that she's letting me know that I'm neglecting them? I understand and know that depression is not easy to overcome, I just want to give in as much help and support I can offer. What should I do to help my friend out? Should I actually leave her alone when she requests it? Any advice or constructive criticism would be very helpful!

I would love to work on some games in the future but now I'm just living in hell. I barely pass all modules and it's not fun when you are forced to learn programming. 
I just want to stop studying but it's not that easy. I am very very shy and introverted and working in a new environment with new people is just not for me. I had several internships before and everyone of them made me more depressed and even suicidal because I just cant work for 8h. 
I would love to just not work but where am I supposed to get money from? My boyfriend cant pay rent and stuff for both of us. I would love to use the time and work on my art skills so maybe I can become a freelancer. I really love being creative but there is no job that is offering that.
It's really mentally exhausting since all I wanna do is be at home and work at my own skills. I hate that you have to have some sort of income. I mean, I could go back home to my mother but I have so many bad memories in my hometown that this will just make everything worse and I also dont wanna be away from my bf.
 I don't know what to do anymore, it seems that there are no good solutions. And I can only get support from government when I'm 25 years old, otherwise my parents have to financially help me out (which is not possible).

"By that I mean, am I an asshole for applying for disability as a depressed person? So it sounds like a joke but this is a true anxiety.My story without getting into it because its not the point just so you understand where I'm from.

Warning for all kinds of trauma.

I live in Australia and I grew up in an abusive house. Mum would verbally attack my dad and the kids, he'd get drunk and beat her in front of us and around and around we go. Mum finally left him for good when I was 8 because my eldest sister turned fourteen and declared she wasn't going back and would keep me and my other sister with her at the halfway house.

So mum got a government funded house and took off in search of a good time and a new husband leaving my two older sisters to raise me. they were 18 and 16 to my 8 at the time. Left alone days at a time, my sisters pulled cash in hand work to feed us. My dad got visiting rights so when we went over there we were fed and clothed and he spoilt us rotten especially me but in unhealthy amounts. eventually my sisters stopped going but I loved it because there I could stay up as late as I want never bathe eat myself sick on junk and watch whatever adult tv I wanted. All I had to do was agree mum was a B\*tch and leave dad alone to do whatever he wanted.

meanwhile at mums place she found a miner to latch too with three kids of his own. so now we were six kids between 18-3 being left alone days at a time and sharing one room.

two years later my elder sisters ran away, my father cut contact as it was too much to deal with my mother trying to see me (which i learnt to forgive him as an adult but as a kid it hurt) and we were in a slightly bigger house. it was me and my step sister in one room, my two step brothers in another and my parents in the last. again, my mother was not present, either sleeping, or out socialising or gambling or in the shed smoking. my dad either worked or joined her. Now I was the caretaker.

Needless to say various abuse emotional verbal occasionally physical and by my teens I'm pretty messed up. I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend.  I'm eighteen, 140 kilos and move out of the room I share with my sister into a unit with my boyfriend who, you probably guessed it, was abusive. over time he conditioned me to stay away from technology but the tv and Xbox, cut what few friends I had out, only family I could really see without some sort of manipulative guilt trip was my mother because she'd drive me straight into his arms. He had control of everything, finances, time, everything.

so now I'm twenty three, married and pregnant with my first child. completely isolated and dependant. Police come a-knocking when I'm two months from birth and low and behold turns out my guy isn't a great fella. He had child exploitation on his Pc and planned to harm my daughter once she was born, sending photos and ultrasounds to prove intent. Oh but don't worry cause mummy was there to pick me up.

I escape her when I'm 24 and bubs nine months old for my own house but i don't fully shake her free until two years after that. Obviously as from all the above, I am not a mentally stable person. For my daughter I start to try and sort myself out.

until my daughter is five, I took those years to do some inward looking and healing. I go to therapy, I find a antidepressant that works, I clip out the bad and keep only those positive influences.

I have Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have a medical diagnosis of only the Depression so far but the others are being worked on in therapy. When my kid is five i start dating and just before she's six I meet a wonderful guy who really IS wonderful! (I made my therapist check. He is very understanding of my trust issues and agreed to sit with me on sessions)

Now to the disabled part. currently, I am 30 with a seven year old girl and a eight month old girl. I'm in a stable relationship with a solid partner. Due to Covid and rising Rents, we were forced to move in with his parents and His sister who live with his grandparents. So yeah four generations, nine people. one house. We live in a room with my two daughters. Due to Covid and being a lifeguard during this time, my partner lost his job at the pool. So there is no employment.

Both of us have been job seeking, him about a year and me since bub was weaned. We've also been rental searching but there's just nothing in our price range and those that ARE don't want an unemployed family.

I have nightmares, PTSD flashes (for me that's flashes of rage that make me barely restrain the urge to hurt myself or very occasionally other people. Or flashes of devastation that take me out by causing hysterical sobbing and emotional pain) Panic attacks and depressive numbness that could last for days where I struggle to care about anything at all even my beautiful kids.

I'm try, he's trying and we are drowning while my depression uses the situation to become even worse. So finally I've decided enough is enough. I'm going to the doctor to talk about options for disability and what services can help.

so finally we come to the point of this post. Am I disabled? because as silly as it sounds reading this as if it were someone else I'd think 'yes of course' but because its ME my brain keeps saying that I'm being a fool. Ill be cast out of the doctors office and banned from Centrelink and lose everything if I try. I feel greedy and stupid and mean and lazy even thinking about applying.

Anyone got a similar story or any idea if I'm even eligible? I swear I don't want to sit on benefits and drain resources, I just want some help getting a job that won't put me in a hospital or the ground due to my condition and maybe some help getting a place so I'm not boxed in. I feel like I'm going mad beating myself to death against the bars of a cage.",1,mean asshole applying disability depressed person sound like joke true anxiety story without getting point understand

Im a loser. A pathetic, disgusting, waste of life loser who’s a drain on everyone around her. You could not find a bigger example of a loser if you tried. Im 29, never been in a romantic relationship of any kind. No boyfriends. Not even a single date. Im a disgusting
 360 pounds. Despite trying countless times to lose weight it just keeps packing on and on. No matter what I do. I’ve never had a job, no driver’s license and I’m sleeping on my moms couch because the idea of going out into the world feels me with so much dread and anxiety I want to curl up in a ball and sob forever. Every time I step outside the door I feel as though every person I meet is judging me, hating me, laughing at me. Like they all can see what I see and they all know what a waste I am. This of course adds to the depression. I was raised to work hard and be independent. Not having a job, having to sleep on my mothers couch, kills me. I want to have a job. I want to contribute. I hate being a burden and a drain on my family. There’s nothing I hate about myself more than that. I beat myself up constantly for being lazy and weak for not stepping up and being an adult like I’m supposed to be. Everyone else I know has accomplished so much and I’m this sad freak who has done NOTHING! 

Sometimes I beg God to give me someone else’s cancer or disease. To kill me in a car accident or something. There are so many people who deserve to have the life I’m just wasting. I feel so guilty.

I try so hard to push through the depression but it seems like everything is 1 step forward, 2 steps back. And I feel like at this point it’s delusional of me to think there is any hope of me achieving the life I do so desperately want. I try. Really I do. I try so hard everyday to be better, to do better but it’s like there’s a cement wall in front of me preventing me from going forward. And this inability to move on makes me hate myself more, which makes everything so much worse. 

I know I need help but I can’t afford therapy. I want so much to just feel better, just a little bit. Just to not hate myself so so much. 

I’m scared if something dosnt change I’m gonna end up ending my life. And I really don’t want that. I want a life. I want to see the world and be a part of it and fall in love and all that. But it seems like I’m doomed to be this pathetic, lifeless, thing  forever. Every day the thought of ending it all gets more and more comforting.

"One of the main things holding me back from talking about my problems is that a lot of the time, the people who want to help don't plan on talking about it for very long. Or at least that's what I think happens. Most of the time the sequence of events goes something like me explaining the problem and the person I'm explaining to responding with something along the lines of ""just be more positive"" or ""don't be so hard on yourself""... Okay, but HOW exactly do I do that? Can other people just change their mindset like a light switch? Because I sure can't, at least not until I burn myself out on feeling like absolute rubbish for a few hours.

I'm being rhetorical right now because the two former questions aren't what I want to talk about, but when I do legitimately ask something like that it seems to somehow offend people like I'm ""rejecting"" their solution which took a staggering three seconds to craft. It's so common and borderline humiliating that I'm often terrified to disagree with any suggested solution for fear of the classic ""you don't want help and are just seeking attention"" response. Whenever I get told something like that, I get immediately slammed with a wave of rage and sometimes guilt now that the person who I was hoping would try to help me has suddenly switched sides and is now insulting me.",1,one main thing holding back talking problem lot time people want help plan talking long least think happens time sequence event go something like explaining problem person explaining responding something along line positive hard okay exactly people change mindset like light switch sure least burn feeling like absolute rubbish hour rhetorical right two former question want talk legitimately ask something like seems somehow offend people like rejecting solution took staggering three second craft common borderline humiliating often terrified disagree suggested solution fear classic want help seeking attention response whenever get told something like get immediately slammed wave rage sometimes guilt person wa hoping would try help ha suddenly switched side insulting,one main thing holding back talking problem lot time people want help plan talking long least think happens time sequence event go something like explaining problem person explaining responding something along line positive hard okay exactly people change mindset like light switch sure least burn feeling like absolute rubbish hour rhetorical right two former question want talk legitimately ask something like seems somehow offend people like rejecting solution took staggering three second craft common borderline humiliating often terrified disagree suggested solution fear classic want help seeking attention response whenever get told something like get immediately slammed wave rage sometimes guilt person wa hoping would try help ha suddenly switched side insulting
"Many times I thought my self, Why killing Yourself If out there are worst people living a ""life"". My point is I'm thinking that I'm a piece of shiet, just because I do nothing with my life and isolating myself. 

Many things that I want to do... I can't do it because of my fucking depression. Dude, I really hate myself for not take care of the People I love and is not because I do something wrong... Is because I just being in my room sleeping all day. I literally I'm starting not feeling emotions for other people (Like for a Relationship) 
I don't like women or men, I have like 1 year without having sex with anyone and my last sexual encounters don't even feel good anymore... Sometimes I watch porn and I just don't feel nothing is boring and meaningless, at this point actually nearly everything is meaningless. Why this frequently thought is haunted me. I'm trying to live  but all that I do is killing Time.

I have been on different jobs, and I left for the same reason. Everything is feeling empty, I don't care about buying ""stuff""... At this point I don't care if I just slowly kill myself smoking cigarettes. I feel so ashamed I don't even like the taste of cigarettes anymore I just smoke it.
Many friends are gone. I don't talk to anyone I'm slowly becoming a Socially Inept, that kinda bothers me, at this point I don't even know how to talk ""Normally"" to another human being, because I don't have anything to say. Everything is just awful, I kinda miss my childhood and all my childhood Friends are now just memories that I keep, for at least something happy to remember.

Im becoming more and more isolating everyday pass.

I have some friends... Can pass a whole month and I don't talk to anyone because my shitty mind thinks that I just bothering... So I just stay quiet. I'm pretty sure that is all my fault, I guess I need learn and accept being alone. I try to talk with them but I just have that feeling that they don't want talk to me anymore, If I don't talk first they don't even write me a message.

In very rare occasions I hang out (Individually) with 2 fiends, I can have a very good time with them playing video games etc. But then they just Disappear...

And that's basically my life right now. At least I have a medical prescription and taking my pills but I have nearly 2 years and many times I don't feel anything. 

Why I'm not just killing myself and that's it?

I have feeling that I don't want to hurt my family. But I know they don't live forever. And then, What is gonna happen? Feeling more confident to kill myself because there is no one left that I can possibly hurt. I just wanted to told you about my thoughts that I have frequently... I hope I can change my mind and not being this like this anymore. But I don't trust my own mind...

"I was doing so much better right before COVID, I was finally getting over my anxiety. I screwed up so many opportunities with woman because of that. I'm still a virgin at 37.

The pandemic hit, and all of my progress went away.  Now it's just depression. I spend all of my time online harassing anti-vaxxers because they're fucking idiots who are keeping this pandemic going. When I'm not doing that I drink or being hungover. I drink every other day, I stop drinking then I feel better.. then drink again.

I don't drink at work, but I'm having trouble getting to work on time. I wake up early enough.. but I just lie there in bed. I used to like going to the office and seeing my work friends.. but they all mostly work from home now so I barely see anyone anymore. I had only 1 friend outside of work and I don't talk to him anymore. He's too far gone into the anti-mask / vaccine ideology now. I just want this fucking pandemic to be over with and he's one of the people keeping it going.

I live alone. I'm getting lazy with cutting my lawn.. I need to paint inside.. but I don't have the energy for that anymore. I'm really getting fat.. I don't do much exercise and I get takeout all the time. I make enough money where that's not an issue. Even with me being hungover all the time, I'm the MVP at work, and they pay me well because I know what I'm doing. It's dangerous.. because I always have money for booze now.

I think I need to get laid or something, but I'm a social idiot with no friends. This fucking pandemic is making everyone isolated and anit-social. I worked so hard to get over that.. then the whole world turned into what I hated about myself. Fuck this planet.

I’m the midst of me trying to get my mom to do little task she looked me dead in my eyes and said “I don’t like you, your brother never made me do this.” I was shocked but basically went back to my old way of living and dissociated from the situation and said “ I don’t care if you don’t like me you still have to do this.” She immediately acted like she never said that and that I was putting words in her mouth.

"Hi and thank you for your time!
I've been through some really rough times for the past few months and it became really hard for me to find anything that I enjoy doing. 
This is the first time I'm actually talking about this and I went through some stuff, but I figured out this would take way too long for you to read.
I need to mention that I am currently an unemployed student so I can't afford going to therapy even though I'd need it and talking to my friends is not an option for me. 
I also know there are maybe hundreds of posts about this subject, but I felt like I also needed to open myself a little, so don't be hard on me, please.
So, these being said, I was wondering how do you manage to make yourself feel better when having a bad day?

"Biggest contributor to my depression is loneliness, not receiving the love and worth I seek etc.

I am in campus, dorm whatever and should study; yet I get very depressed because of how many people are studying or spending time together. I can't focus on my work, and all I think about is how much I am missing out and how far I have fallen back, and how I would never attain socialization like that. Basically, other people serve as a reminder to how much of a loner loser I am.

"Hey all,

I'm asking this because I really want to know if there's help. I'm 37 years old. I've been depressed most of my life and suffer from bad anxiety. On paper, I look OK -- good job, decent salary (hard time keeping money), great dog. But it seems no matter how hard I try to find peace or happiness, I cannot do it. I've been to multiple therapists. This last one, I've been with for about 3-4 years now, and she's been great. I'm on medication. But I'm getting to the point where it just feels like there's something incurable about me where the core of me is just... sad. Broken. I know there are others like me out there and I can put up a front if I need to for a little while (assuming I get enough sleep), and most people who don't know me consider me charming, intelligent, giving, etc. But it just is never enough for me to feel at peace, let alone happy. 

I'm not even sure what else to do anymore. I've felt hopeless a lot in my life, but it's beginning to feel even more like I don't have much of a future beyond working, making ends meet (and not getting a house), not getting a girl or relationship, etc. Things that bring me joy are few and far between - I just don't feel it. I've had blood tests and nothing seem to be wrong. I live alone, work alone. There are so many times I just want to pack it up, give my dog to a better owner (that's irrational though - I take great care of her, she loves me, gets two walks a day, good food, medical care, and a lot of love), and just lie down somewhere forever. I just am feeling less and less like there's much of a future for me. Yes, suicide comes into my mind all the time, but A - no means here (primary contingency plan) B - extreme fear of it (grew up Catholic and going to hell is still somehow in the back of my mind). Plus, there’s something inside of me that still says there has to be a way back from this to a better place.

I just am in so much pain and I'm just bugging people at this point. I can't even really talk to people anymore. They have their own stuff going on, and I get that they look at me and think ""just think happy"" or that I'm not doing anything about it. I really do get their position, and don't blame them. I'm just an energy vampire at this point. Last time I was happy was when I was dating a few months prior to the pandemic. I'm attempting it again, but not having the same success/experience (and success is stretching it a bit for the last time). But even now, I feel like there's something so depressed and broken inside of me that even if I can show someone a good time, get them laughing, even connect with them, I feel like that's a front and the true me is this mess inside. 

Does anyone have any ideas? Has anyone ever overcome this? I feel like the world and time is closing in on me, and I just don't want to be in this much pain anymore.",1,hey asking really want know help 37 year old depressed life suffer bad anxiety paper look ok good job decent salary hard time keeping money great dog seems matter hard try find peace happiness cannot multiple therapist last one 3 4 year great medication getting point feel like something incurable core sad broken know others like put front need little assuming get enough sleep people know consider charming intelligent giving etc never enough feel peace let alone happy even sure else anymore felt hopeless lot life beginning feel even like much future beyond working making end meet getting house getting girl relationship etc thing bring joy far feel blood test nothing seem wrong live alone work alone many time want pack give dog better owner irrational though take great care love get two walk day good food medical care lot love lie somewhere forever feeling le le like much future yes suicide come mind time mean primary contingency plan b extreme fear grew catholic going hell still somehow back mind plus something inside still say ha way back better place much pain bugging people point even really talk people anymore stuff going get look think think happy anything really get position blame energy vampire point last time wa happy wa wa dating month prior pandemic attempting success experience success stretching bit last time even feel like something depressed broken inside even show someone good time get laughing even connect feel like front true mess inside doe anyone idea ha anyone ever overcome feel like world time closing want much pain anymore,hey asking really want know help 37 year old depressed life suffer bad anxiety paper look ok good job decent salary hard time keeping money great dog seems matter hard try find peace happiness cannot multiple therapist last one 3 4 year great medication getting point feel like something incurable core sad broken know others like put front need little assuming get enough sleep people know consider charming intelligent giving etc never enough feel peace let alone happy even sure else anymore felt hopeless lot life beginning feel even like much future beyond working making end meet getting house getting girl relationship etc thing bring joy far feel blood test nothing seem wrong live alone work alone many time want pack give dog better owner irrational though take great care love get two walk day good food medical care lot love lie somewhere forever feeling le le like much future yes suicide come mind time mean primary contingency plan b extreme fear grew catholic going hell still somehow back mind plus something inside still say ha way back better place much pain bugging people point even really talk people anymore stuff going get look think think happy anything really get position blame energy vampire point last time wa happy wa wa dating month prior pandemic attempting success experience success stretching bit last time even feel like something depressed broken inside even show someone good time get laughing even connect feel like front true mess inside doe anyone idea ha anyone ever overcome feel like world time closing want much pain anymore
"A few months ago, I tried to talk to new people at my school. Every time I did, however, I felt drained and unsatisfied with the conversation.

I’ve already drafted the emails with as much transparency as possible, but I’m worried I should do it in person instead for some reason.

"Many forms of psychotherapy focus solely on the mind, where practitioners believe many problems originate. However, research has shown that trauma and other experiences that produce negative emotions can dramatically affect other areas of the human body.The field of somatic psychotherapy is founded on the notion that emotions can get stuck within some body regions, resulting in physical complaints such as tension, poor posture, and chronic pain.Although therapies that focus predominantly on the mind can help individuals identify and overcome—both cognitively and emotionally—distressing conditions, treatment approaches that include the mind, body, and spirit, like somatic psychotherapy, add body awareness and movement to act as a bridge between the mind and body.

What Is Somatic Psychotherapy?

Somatic psychotherapy, sometimes called body psychotherapy, bodywork, body-oriented psychotherapy, body-focused therapy, or somatic therapy, is a holistic approach in which practitioners use the connection between the mind and body, and, in some cases, the spirit, to promote both emotional and physical healing.

Somatic psychotherapy posits that people who receive this treatment can heal more effectively than those who receive only traditional talk therapy, which does not engage these entrenched bodily memories.

Types of Somatic Psychotherapy

Many forms of somatic psychotherapy exist. Some forms focus primarily on body awareness and movement, and others combine body-centric therapies with cognitive therapies for enhanced results. Although several forms may seem to overlap, the various types of somatic psychotherapy are mostly distinct; they use different approaches and strategies to achieve their goal of integrating mind and body to heal.

"my background:

last summer i met up with a psychiatrist the first time. honestly, i felt like i didn’t get to talk about everything ive been feeling, but i got prescribed w/ prozac for 6 months anyways. our first meeting felt so rushed. it was sort of like, “oh just answer the following questions about your family history and your hobbies then we’ll be on our way.”
it was kind of a let down since i had been fighting to get professional help for 7 months before that. But anyways, I got prescribed with Prozac for my low moods (idk if it’s normal for psychiatrists to do that, she didnt say anything about depression)

these past 3 months I’ve been on and off my meds (mostly off), and these past 2 weeks I’ve been feeling really off. it’s been a huge rollercoaster.


1. I’ve been behind on school work. I cant get myself to do it at all, and I feel terrible.
2. I haven’t been attending most of my classes (i’m anxious about my teachers confronting me about my missing work, i had a traumatic experience with a terror teacher once, so this is why).
3. my body dysmorphia has gotten worse, mainly cause of my mom’s comments on my body.
4. empty. Brain fog
5. Have had two major meltdowns these past few weeks, one of them I almost relapsed into self harm
6. Withdrawing/isolating myself from my peers. I can feel them getting worried, including my teachers. I can’t open up with them, I don’t want to because what help can they give me that I haven’t already tried myself?
7. Had a couple of suicidal thoughts during those two major meltdowns

"Tw - suicidal ideation 

I want to build a life that I'm not actively escaping from. Right now, I dread going to work every single day. Working is the source of my depression. But I feel the extra pressure to hold down a job and climb the career ladder like everyone else. 

I'm not in a critical situation now. I'm doing much better than my high school days when I was completely dysfunctional. I'm healthier than 2018 when I had suicidal thoughts every single moment and in early 2019 when I had the urge to jump out of the window for a month.

But nowadays there's a feeling of despair and loneliness that I can't seem to handle. I don't want a luxurious life. I want to spend my days working a low stress job even if it's low income and lead a very simple life. 

I tried to spend time on my hobbies but that motivation quickly disappeared. Now I can only muster enough energy for reading and long walks. No music, no drawing, no yoga anymore because I can't be bothered. I'd be lying to say that I don't have suicidal ideation now. Medication is not the answer. The psychiatrist gave me the lowest dosage because I recovered leaps and bounds after quitting my last job. 

I just can't deal with the world. Wish I could focus only on my side gig which requires minimal interaction with people. 

If I die tomorrow... That would be great (lol jk). If I die tomorrow, I would feel sad because I wasted my life feeling sad and stressed.",1,tw suicidal ideation want build life actively escaping right dread going work every single day working source depression feel extra pressure hold job climb career ladder like everyone else critical situation much better high school day wa completely dysfunctional healthier 2018 suicidal thought every single moment early 2019 urge jump window month nowadays feeling despair loneliness seem handle want luxurious life want spend day working low stress job even low income lead simple life tried spend time hobby motivation quickly disappeared muster enough energy reading long walk music drawing yoga anymore bothered lying say suicidal ideation medication answer psychiatrist gave lowest dosage recovered leap bound quitting last job deal world wish could focus side gig requires minimal interaction people die tomorrow would great lol jk die tomorrow would feel sad wasted life feeling sad stressed,tw suicidal ideation want build life actively escaping right dread going work every single day working source depression feel extra pressure hold job climb career ladder like everyone else critical situation much better high school day wa completely dysfunctional healthier 2018 suicidal thought every single moment early 2019 urge jump window month nowadays feeling despair loneliness seem handle want luxurious life want spend day working low stress job even low income lead simple life tried spend time hobby motivation quickly disappeared muster enough energy reading long walk music drawing yoga anymore bothered lying say suicidal ideation medication answer psychiatrist gave lowest dosage recovered leap bound quitting last job deal world wish could focus side gig requires minimal interaction people die tomorrow would great lol jk die tomorrow would feel sad wasted life feeling sad stressed
"I have a friendship that I think has been in the later stages prior to no communication. It has happened plenty of times before, I should be used to it, but Im not. It hurts a lot every time, especially this time because this friend gave me a bit of hope this past year or so.
Communication has been short, inconsistent and avoided by the other person. I have been trying to confront them for the past three+ months but havent really had time based on their schedule. I don’t want to do it through text. But, thats another story.
Truth is, I have let this anxiety and fear consume the last five months of my life. The status of my failing friendship and the dread of watching it fail is all I can think about. I have tried to think about things logically, comfort myself saying theres nothing I can do, trying to go out and find new people, find hobbies. I cant enjoy any of it.

"I'll be perfectly honest and admit that I don't know if she's been officially diagnosed with depression or not. I don't know if she's taking medication; I know she doesn't have a therapist or psychiatrist.

She's made half a dozen posts on social media I'm the last 24 hours about having another break up, and one of them is the first time that I have ever seen or heard her mention suicide. She didn't directly say that she's feeling the urge to, but said she's jealous of those who've had the nerve to do it.

I live on the other side of the country. We've kept in touch and talk at least once a week, whether it's a conversation over the phone, texting, or commenting on one another's social media posts and having a conversation there. She's usually very happy and smiling, though I know she's been sad and felt lonely for years.

She has had financial struggles ever since I've known her. She rarely asks for help and always pays back when she does, so anytime she's needed financial help, we haven't hesitated. But she still struggles to get on her own two feet. From a distance, it has always looked to me like whenever she's started to get on her feet, she ends up finding a boyfriend, throws everything at him (money, love, emotion) and then is devastated when things don't work out.

She found religion a few years ago and posts about it all the time. It seemed like her faith was keeping her optimistic, even through break ups, but this new post mentioning suicide has me scared.

I know she has friends in her area as well. I see them responding to her issue all the time and offering her help (financial, living, and just emotional support). But I want to know if there's anything I can do for her from my distance.

Sending flowers, fruit baskets, balloons... All seem so cliche and like they really wouldn't help in her state of depression. I wish I could fly over just to hug her, but I can't. I wish I could fly her to me and have her stay with so I could take care of her and her get get in her own two feet, but I can't.

I know of course no one can know this… but curious on reddits take. I’ve been struggling with depression for a while and my best friend never cared and always was there to listen. However, recently my friend became more distant so I asked what’s up. Last week he basically had a long talk or intervention you can call it, with me saying like “I was a family member” and needed to give it to me straight about improving mental health. He reassured me everything was okay. 3 days later, I spoke to him again and just asked why he was being so distant suddenly and were we still friends. He said it’s okay if we don’t talk everyday, busy at work and life has been busy. Plus he said I talked to him a lot. I didn’t understand this as he would call and text me a lot first too. Before he hung up he asked if I was seriously okay twice and I said yeah it’s fine. Now the last couple days, I just feel like the air is weird. No more sending snaps, no more shooting me funny memes. 

We are both 27, in a relationship. I just don’t know what’s going on and miss our normal friendship. My friends have said to just give space and he will come back around.  I had a massive falling out with someone else years ago so I’m praying this isn’t the same.

"TL:DR  
Dealing with a bad depression episode that changed us and my relationship. She can not take things anymore and wants out, how can I improve things?

I am a \[39M\] suffering from a persistent slumbering depression. From an early age on I've always felt flawed. I struggled in school, got bullied, my parents hit me and could be emotionally neglectful, undiagnosed ADHD explained a lot of those issues though when I was diagnosed about three years ago. I felt stuck at work at that time and was dealing with a bad breakup after a very long relationship. This self help journey ultimately led to my depression diagnosis. I got CBT and was put on ADHD meds that helped out a bunch with my ADHD.  

Now on to my current situation and my reason for this post:  

About 2,5 years ago I met this great girl and we hit it of in have been in a long distance relationship.   
She's loving, positive and very helpful. She can be short tempered though and has some insecurities. 

Unfortunately my work situation went from bad to worse and I just couldnt do it anymore. I got help and this led to some more help from a shrink but I was put on hold and ended up stuck at home for almost two years now and I never felt so lonely, sad and depressed. Also this Covid19 pandemic did not help things either. Right now I am seeing another shrink and a psychiatrist that is helping me out with my ADHD meds.   

But at this moment I feel so tired and like I can not enjoy things anymore. I feel resentful and frustrated. Obviously I am in a bad place and this unfortunately damaged my relationship and my sweet girlfriend.   

I noticed her pulling away from me, getting frustrated with me and or irritated easily. At times I've gotten the silent treatment. Sometimes I acted out in a way that hurt her in stressful situations or moments where I felt like I've failled. Like forgetting important things, not doing something or being late (again and again).   
She got mad or gave me the silent treatment. My anxiety got the better of me sometimes and I was frustrated. 
Off course we talked, and that was difficult sometimes.
I felt sad, misunderstood and she felt like talking about it was a bad thing or couldn't understand why I felt that way. I can't expect her to understand everything realistically.

Last night she got annoyed, ignored me and ultimately told me she did not see a future for us in that way. My sombreness, some of the anxiety driven behavior and display of a victim mentality hurt her and those have  crossed certain boundaries.  
   
She meant to tell me this before, even left some breadcrumbs via text. I only noticed her pulling away, losing interest or giving me the silent treatment. I could have guessed this was on her mind but maybe I was to scared to have a talk. I feel sad that she has been dealing with this for a while and how difficult that must have been. She told me that she'd given me the benefit of the doubt a couple of weeks ago but never mentioned this to me like so. I do feel her way of going about this and her communication could have been better. I don't feel respected but then again this must have been difficult and she told me that it felt like abandoning me.  
I have crossed her boundaries and I completely understand why she did not want this situation anymore because it made her feel bad.

I am so caught up in my current mental state that I have trouble going about things. Like literally doing anything some days or going somewhere (on time) is hard, and I hate that! I don't have a great outlook and dealing with my thoughts, anxiety and all that other crap made lose myself my self worth and the man I wanted to be. 

She told me she still loves me and does not want to give up on me. She recognises this is my situation and that I am not the guy she fell in love with right now. She needs some time to find herself and I need to get a grip on my situation..  

I could really use some advice and would love to have your input or experiences.  

I know:
I want to improve my communication and our communication.  
I want to manage my outbursts better.

"Today I woke up to the sound of my neighbours bellow me screaming, arguing and slamming shit. It’s been happening more often lately, especially on the weekends. I have ptsd, bpd, &amp; severe GAD &amp; depression. I moved out of my parents 4 years ago to escape a toxic home. I was raised in a family who always screams at each other, constant bickering, slamming shit and breaking furniture. I have grown severe mental issues because of my childhood and flinch easily at loud noises. 

I live in a very old apartment building in a rough part of town because it’s all I can afford. Covid robbed me of my dream job &amp; all friendships, so I have been a loser sitting at home playing video games all day to escape reality while living off EI. I’m pretty sure my benefits just ended today, idk, I’ve been too scared to look. I’ve saved up 3 months worth of rent and I’m too scared to spend any money because I don’t want to get a job because I’m too adhd for university and couldn’t pick a career for the life of me. Now I’m a jobless loser with 0 ambition to be a wage slave.

I am stuck living in this apartment that *used* to be the nicer part of the shit area. Well thanks to covid, my rental management accepts anyone &amp; everyone to keep rooms filled so now there’s lots of crackheads and sketchy people who live here. The lobby is always filled with garbage now, homeless peoples bikes and garbage bags parked INSIDE the lobby while they buy crack from suite 18 bc they marked in the elevator. Oh there’s now crackheads spraying grafiti on the inside of the elevator door too. I am living in a shithole, but this is what I get for being a useless loser living in poverty.

The walls and floors are paper thin so I awoke to the couple beneath me screaming and slamming. I left the apartment at 10 am to escape the incoming panic attack I would have if I listened to it any longer. I come back at 2pm praying they would be done, but nope. Still screaming at each other. I am broke and cannot afford a lot of furniture so I hear EVERYTHING. They always slam shit so hard it shakes my floors and triggers my ptsd very badly, I think the person is getting abused downstairs so I had enough and finally called the police on them to file a domestic abuses complaint. I packed up my ps4 and let the cops in as I made my way out.

I’ve resorted to going to my parents on the weekends to avoid their slamming and fighting. I’m so sick of living in a shithole and being forced to stay away from home every fucking weekend. I miss my poor cat who is my lifeline, I don’t like having to leave her alone. But if I stay it triggers my manic depressive BPD and I’ll just lay in silence fixating on the thumping and arguing while I contemplate suicide bc I hate my fucking situation. 

No one will probably read this because it’s so long, but I’m tired of being poor. I’m tired of having noisy abuso e neighbours triggering my BPD by slamming shit shaking my floors every fucking day. I’m scared of going back to my apartment tomorrow because even though the cops came, nothing will change. I still live in a shithole and a never ending nightmare of being woke up to slamming. I’m tired of careless people. A couple weeks ago they triggered a BPD episode to the point where I punched a hole in the wall. They love to blast music and movies with their big ass bass that shakes my floors. I wrote a letter to them begging them to stop. Nothing changed. The rental company will do nothing as always. Or they’ll kick them out so crackheads will move in.

No where feels safe anymore. I miss my poor baby cat who is alone at home now. Im scared to go back to my apartment tomorrow because they’ll probably just keep slamming shit. I CSNT afford to move to a new place. I can’t find a job.

I am currently on risperidone (antipsychotic) at night time so I’m calm now, but during the day my mind is hell. My antidepressants don’t work and my doctors refuse to switch my to different ones. CBT works for a day or 2, but I’m back to a negative mindset when I have to deal with this shit at home 24/7.

If someone manages to read this all and can give advice … thank you. But I truly see suicide as the only way out of this shit life. Im tired of suffering bc other ppl are careless. Im terrified to go home tomorrow and be back to being alone with my horrible thoughts as my floors shake bc my neighbours will probably be fighting AGAIN.

I just want it to be over. I wish I could just get it over with and kill myself. Im all alone, suffering always.

To the 0 ppl who read this novel, thanks. Maybe it will be the last I ever post, I just want to die. I don’t think I’m ever escaping this hell.",1,today woke sound neighbour bellow screaming arguing slamming shit happening often lately especially weekend ptsd bpd amp severe gad amp depression moved

"Hi, I am a 22 years old final year student in uni and this year has been terrible to me I have fallen apart with my dad who used to be my entire world but ya got tired of disappoint and all so I just cut him off. after my 2nd year of uni I really struggled in uni I hate the course I'm doing the degree in, I'm terrible at it I'm constantly fearful of not getting 2.1 and I know I wanted to take some time off so I decided to take a gap year in my 2nd year. I am international student in the uk so meant I would have to go back home, but home isn't really home because of my mom all my hurt and trauma comes from that women. its constant feeling of suffocating that my immediate plans when I see her is to run away something my dad is well aware off. I flew back home in the hopes I will figure out my life in that gap year and felt relieved but day I landed I saw my mom and I just crippled all I can think is young me and how much I feared her and him how could he in the time I asked for help(I never ask him for jackshit) in my lowest he brought my demon and just said to tolerate her for his sake. I know he is trying to ease his consciousness that his own kid cannot stand her own mom and I understood that so I just avoided her. but the lack of regret from her side, her smiling, pissed me off more importantly how damaged I am because of her mental/physical abuse,how I had to raise myself, that till this day no matter what I do I'm still bearing this anger and hurt and this is something my dad understands and knows and it just sank and I finally understood that my issue with my mom has been an existing issue that if my dad wanted to intervene he would have long time ago, it clicked that this was my reality and getting an apology or sincere apology from my mom was something that I would never get which honestly I'm not too hurt by because that is something I already expected. its my dad that shattered me I reached out in my lowest a moment where I felt I was sinking and I trusted his word that he would be here for me and help me out and I desperately wanted to believe that so I did. But I was met with a reality that I didn't want to know and now I'm just a complete reck. I am worse now at least before I flew home I had some control of what I was feeling but now nah I'm just floating my chest hurts, I'm unmotivated and I just angry.

tomorrow uni starts meaning my last year and I have no motivation at all it is as if my body has given up on me, even listening to a lecture feels like I have exercised for hours and I just feel fatigued. I know this year I have to do excellent so I can move on from all of them but I'm worried I suck in what I'm studying its difficult the uni I go to is competitive and difficult and I'm too scared I won't even get a 2.1, I also feel exhausted like I have nothing to give anymore and I don't know how to overcome this or even if I ever will. I have been running away my entire life and now at the end they have destroyed me I am just completely shattered so any advice from anyone who went through this ? please help me, guide Me like wtf is this and what can I do to get over this and I'm not sinking",1,hi 22 year old final year student uni year ha terrible fallen apart dad used entire world ya got tired disappoint cut 2nd year uni really struggled uni hate course degree terrible constantly fearful getting 2 1 know wanted take time decided take gap year 2nd year international student uk meant would go back home home really home mom hurt trauma come woman constant feeling suffocating immediate plan see run away something dad well aware flew back home hope figure life gap year felt relieved day landed saw mom crippled think young much feared could time asked help never ask jackshit lowest brought demon said tolerate sake know trying ease consciousness kid cannot stand mom understood avoided lack regret side smiling pissed importantly damaged mental physical abuse raise till day matter still bearing anger hurt something dad understands know sank finally understood issue mom ha existing issue dad wanted intervene would long time ago clicked wa reality getting apology sincere apology mom wa something would never get honestly hurt something already expected dad shattered reached lowest moment felt wa sinking trusted word would help desperately wanted believe wa met reality want know complete reck worse least flew home control wa feeling nah floating chest hurt unmotivated angry tomorrow uni start meaning last year motivation body ha given even listening lecture feel like exercised hour feel fatigued know year excellent move worried suck studying difficult uni go competitive difficult scared even get 2 1 also feel exhausted like nothing give anymore know overcome even ever running away entire life end destroyed completely shattered advice anyone went please help guide like wtf get sinking,hi 22 year old final year student uni year ha terrible fallen apart dad used entire world ya got tired disappoint cut 2nd year uni really struggled uni hate course degree terrible constantly fearful getting 2 1 know wanted take time decided take gap year 2nd year international student uk meant would go back home home really home mom hurt trauma come woman constant feeling suffocating immediate plan see run away something dad well aware flew back home hope figure life gap year felt relieved day landed saw mom crippled think young much feared could time asked help never ask jackshit lowest brought demon said tolerate sake know trying ease consciousness kid cannot stand mom understood avoided lack regret side smiling pissed importantly damaged mental physical abuse raise till day matter still bearing anger hurt something dad understands know sank finally understood issue mom ha existing issue dad wanted intervene would long time ago clicked wa reality getting apology sincere apology mom wa something would never get honestly hurt something already expected dad shattered reached lowest moment felt wa sinking trusted word would help desperately wanted believe wa met reality want know complete reck worse least flew home control wa feeling nah floating chest hurt unmotivated angry tomorrow uni start meaning last year motivation body ha given even listening lecture feel like exercised hour feel fatigued know year excellent move worried suck studying difficult uni go competitive difficult scared even get 2 1 also feel exhausted like nothing give anymore know overcome even ever running away entire life end destroyed completely shattered advice anyone went please help guide like wtf get sinking
"I’m really struggling today.    My normal coping techniques (getting outside, watching a favorite show, etc) aren’t working.    

Weekends are always tough for me.   But it’s now October and my late Mom’s birthday is in two weeks.   I was her caregiver.   She would’ve been 65.  Qualifying for Medicare and we could’ve gotten so much more help for her paraplegia.    And since she was a teacher (i.e. state worker) she didn’t qualify for disability or other help.  

Thanks for nothing for her 25 years of service huh?    Regardless, it’s bothering me more as this is the year her life would’ve gotten easier (and mine) and she’s not here to enjoy that.  I would’ve been helping her with her new paperwork, enjoying the research, etc.  

Add on to that, I took a new job in April, and while good, it’s a big change. I then lost my dog (which was Mom’s as well) in June so I’m now alone.  I’m single as my caregiving responsibilities didn’t give me a lot of dating time or opportunity.  

Nothing much excites me anymore.   My music has fallen to the wayside.   I can’t enjoy playing a video game.   

And trying to lose weight (for health) during all this is just added stress.  

Ive never been a quitter, pretty ambitious guy.   Not anymore.  It took a year to get past my Moms death.   But now losing our dog is like losing her all over again.   Add in pandemic stress on that and there you have it.  

I’ve had some really dark times here as of late.  


Just need to talk and some nonjudgmental help.",1,really struggling today normal coping technique getting outside watching favorite show etc working weekend always tough october late mom birthday two week wa caregiver would 65 qualifying medicare could gotten much help paraplegia since wa teacher e state worker qualify disability help thanks nothing 25 year service huh regardless bothering year life would gotten easier mine enjoy would helping new paperwork enjoying research etc add took new job april good big change lost dog wa mom well june alone single caregiving responsibility give lot dating time opportunity nothing much excites anymore music ha fallen wayside enjoy playing video game trying lose weight health added stress ive never quitter pretty ambitious guy anymore took year get past mom death losing dog like losing add pandemic stress really dark time late need talk nonjudgmental help,really struggling today normal coping technique getting outside watching favorite show etc working weekend always tough october late mom birthday two week wa caregiver would 65 qualifying medicare could gotten much help paraplegia since wa teacher e state worker qualify disability help thanks nothing 25 year service huh regardless bothering year life would gotten easier mine enjoy would helping new paperwork enjoying research etc add took new job april good big change lost dog wa mom well june alone single caregiving responsibility give lot dating time opportunity nothing much excites anymore music ha fallen wayside enjoy playing video game trying lose weight health added stress ive never quitter pretty ambitious guy anymore took year get past mom death losing dog like losing add pandemic stress really dark time late need talk nonjudgmental help

"Last year around this time I was very suicidal. I had made a plan, wrote a will and goodbye letter to family and friends, and was prepared to go through with it but was ultimately talked out of it. I’m in a much better spot now, I’m working with a therapist and I’m not nearly as suicidal as I was but it’s a tad…odd. Ever since I came to terms with my death I’ve felt like my time here is over, or should’ve been last year. Nothing really excites me anymore, I feel like I have no future, and I generally feel like I have no purpose anymore other than just not disappointing friends and family by killing myself. I guess what I’m wondering is if anyone here has felt or feels the same and if so what advice you have to either overcome or manage this feeling.",1,last year around time wa suicidal made plan wrote goodbye letter family friend wa prepared go wa ultimately talked much better spot working therapist nearly suicidal wa tad odd ever since came term death felt like time last year nothing really excites anymore feel like future generally feel like purpose anymore disappointing friend family killing guess wondering anyone ha felt feel advice either overcome manage feeling,last year around time wa suicidal made plan wrote goodbye letter family friend wa prepared go wa ultimately talked much better spot working therapist nearly suicidal wa tad odd ever since came term death felt like time last year nothing really excites anymore feel like future generally feel like purpose anymore disappointing friend family killing guess wondering anyone ha felt feel advice either overcome manage feeling
"I play video games nearly all day every day in my free time, but what I mostly come back to are pvp games. I mostly have fun when i'm winning and that high I get from doing so well is what gets me to keep coming back to them. But more often than not, i'm a high-leveled, or veteran player who can only beat new people. Whenever i'm faced against someone at or above my skill level, (which is more often than I would like) I start getting frustrated, then it turns to physical anger where I hit the table and sometimes seriously hurt some part of my body or break things in a fit of rage from whatever is in my room. 

But the physical pain isn't just what's hurting me, it's also seriously affecting my mental health and gets my depression and eventually tears and hurtful words towards myself to come out after i've belt out my anger. I've never expressed my frustration in chat to anyone, as I know it really won't get me anywhere and will only make me feel more guilty, but I still can't help but to feel absolutely miserable when i'm losing at a game I really love. 

I've tried to distance myself to more casual games but I always keep eventually coming back to these pvp games like some addictive drug because they're just way more fun when i'm winning and I keep insisting that i'll get better eventually, but no matter what I do, no matter what I try, no matter how long i've played, almost everyone seems to be better than me as if they were born with the skill and I wasn't. It just repeats like this, and even though I want so badly to be good at these games, it just keeps going in a cycle and it's tearing apart my progress to happiness again and again because I can only ever see myself as worthless and pathetic when i'm losing to people who are probably years younger than me.

I'm so stuck and I don't know what to do anymore. How to do I break this cycle, how do I stop myself, should I even stop myself? I need help badly from anyone who can offer me advice or can sympathize with what i'm going through.",1,play video game nearly day every day free time mostly come back pvp game mostly fun winning high get well get keep coming back often high leveled veteran player beat new people whenever faced someone skill level often would like start getting frustrated turn physical anger hit table sometimes seriously hurt part body break thing fit rage whatever room physical pain hurting also seriously affecting mental health get depression eventually tear hurtful word towards come belt anger never expressed frustration chat anyone know really get anywhere make feel guilty still help feel absolutely miserable losing game really love tried distance casual game always keep eventually coming back pvp game like addictive drug way fun winning keep insisting get better eventually matter matter try matter long played almost everyone seems better born skill repeat like even though want badly good game keep going cycle tearing apart progress happiness ever see worthless pathetic losing people probably year younger stuck know anymore break cycle stop even stop need help badly anyone offer advice sympathize going,play video game nearly day every day free time mostly come back pvp game mostly fun winning high get well get keep coming back often high leveled veteran player beat new people whenever faced someone skill level often would like start getting frustrated turn physical anger hit table sometimes seriously hurt part body break thing fit rage whatever room physical pain hurting also seriously affecting mental health get depression eventually tear hurtful word towards come belt anger never expressed frustration chat anyone know really get anywhere make feel guilty still help feel absolutely miserable losing game really love tried distance casual game always keep eventually coming back pvp game like addictive drug way fun winning keep insisting get better eventually matter matter try matter long played almost everyone seems better born skill repeat like even though want badly good game keep going cycle tearing apart progress happiness ever see worthless pathetic losing people probably year younger stuck know anymore break cycle stop even stop need help badly anyone offer advice sympathize going

"I feel like I can’t catch a break and I’m just drowning in responsibilities and have little to look forward to. I recently went back to school as an adult student (tried post secondary when younger but had no direction and transitioning during school was shit).

I live by myself, have a dog (he was a gift from my ex, I love my dog but the amount of stress he brings me is exponential). I work in health care and need to keep working to support myself and my dog, even with student loans and I cannot balance the two at all especially with my bosses constantly calling me asking me to work more.

I haven’t had thoughts of suicide for a long time, but today’s just been a day. I found a cockroach in my place despite it being sprayed twice, I spent the past two days struggling to understand math I’ve gone over a million times only to continue to fail online quizzes and despite trying to keep up with school work I’m so behind. The one thing I was looking forward to was a DJ set tonight but I just gave my ticket to someone else so I could continue my 48 hours straight of doing homework that isnt even putting a dent in my work load.

My only breaks have been cleaning (trying to deal with the roach problem) taking care of my dog and other chores. I don’t even have time to do a proper workout.

I’m worried if it keeps going like this I’m going to get even worse mentally. I’m avoiding my girlfriend because I feel like she’ll get turned off by what a downer I am. I don’t know what to do. I need to go to school to get a career, I’m too old to keep switching programs I really want to do well but I feel so fucking stupid and feel like I have no learning skills.

I’ve debated quitting my job, sending my dog to my parents, suicide, dropping out, dropping a course, throwing my phone in a lake so no one can call me I just don’t know how to get a grip. I guess I should’ve expected I couldn’t enjoy things while trying to do school.",1,feel like catch break drowning responsibility little look forward recently went back school adult student tried post secondary younger direction transitioning school wa shit live dog wa gift ex love dog amount stress brings exponential work health care need keep working support dog even student loan cannot balance two especially boss constantly calling asking work thought suicide long time today day found cockroach place despite sprayed twice spent past two day struggling understand math gone million time continue fail online quiz despite trying keep school work behind one thing wa looking forward wa dj set tonight gave ticket someone else could continue 48 hour straight homework isnt even putting dent work load break cleaning trying deal roach problem taking care dog chore even time proper workout worried keep going like going get even worse mentally avoiding girlfriend feel like get turned downer know need go school get career old keep switching program really want well feel fucking stupid feel like learning skill debated quitting job sending dog parent suicide dropping dropping course throwing phone lake one call know get grip guess expected enjoy thing trying school,feel like catch break drowning responsibility little look forward recently went back school adult student tried post secondary younger direction transitioning school wa shit live dog wa gift ex love dog amount stress brings exponential work health care need keep working support dog even student loan cannot balance two especially boss constantly calling asking work thought suicide long time today day found cockroach place despite sprayed twice spent past two day struggling understand math gone million time continue fail online quiz despite trying keep school work behind one thing wa looking forward wa dj set tonight gave ticket someone else could continue 48 hour straight homework isnt even putting dent work load break cleaning trying deal roach problem taking care dog chore even time proper workout worried keep going like going get even worse mentally avoiding girlfriend feel like get turned downer know need go school get career old keep switching program really want well feel fucking stupid feel like learning skill debated quitting job sending dog parent suicide dropping dropping course throwing phone lake one call know get grip guess expected enjoy thing trying school
"Hi everyone well if anyone bothers to even read my post,
So today has been pretty hard for me I am 21 and I feel like I'm lost completely. I am currently a support worker for kids with autism and learning disabilities and I love my job however recently life has been tough on me. Everyone who I work with on my team is going off soon and doing exciting things with their lives but I feel like I'm stuck, I don't even know what I want to do with my life anymore or even if I want to live anymore. I am currently medicated for my depression but it doesn't seem to work anymore. I feel like I am going to have a break down again and try to end it again and I dont know who to turn to anymore. I just feel so lost, I am always putting on a smile and suffering in silence as it feels like I have no body to turn to. Things seem to just get worse as the days go on and I don't know how much longer I can cope with it. I have stopped enjoying everything I used to enjoy all my old coping mechanisms don't seem to work now. I just need someone to talk to. I have already tried to take my life twice once at 17 and the other at 19 both obviously failed. I have already wrote out my suicide note to my family on my phone ready to send when the time comes that I try again. Even writing this I feel just a dull darkness and I'm not sure how I can make it stop.

"I have bad anxiety and stress issues and nothing I have been doing has been working. Let’s just say I was trying to fix it, even though I’ve been too stuck in a hole to help myself. Ive been in a burn out since this past spring, and I can’t seem to get out of it. My anxiety and stress have gotten worse and I don’t get any sleep at night. I don’t think I have insomnia, it’s more like I procrastinate sleep because I don’t want to wake up and go to school, it just gives me too much stress. I don’t know what to do. Is there medication that could fix it? Or is it really just the fact that I am so sleep deprived? I’ve tried to fix my sleep schedule but I always relapse after a couple days..

But because of all of this, my grades are the lowest they’ve been my entire life and it’s honestly making things so much worse. My parents have noticed my grades and have become a lot more strict in order to get me to fix my grades so I can get into the college I want. However, I’m trying to fight too many things at once and it feels like I’m losing my sense of reality.. everything that I once found pleasure in has become dull and it depresses me.

"I’m starting to feel like my life is pointless. I go to work everyday and have people scream at me over things I have no control over (I work as a receptionist at a neurology office) and I get paid minimum wage. I’m only 20, graduates high school but I messed myself up big time. I was in the IB Program for junior and part of senior year (basically college courses so you don’t have to take those classes again in college granted that you pass the classes). I was struggling with anxiety and depression big time. Everytime I walked into a classroom I’d get shaky, lose the ability the speak, my brain turned to fog, my heart rate would speed up and I’d feel on the verge of tears. Every. Little. Thing. Made me feel extremely overwhelmed. I was afraid of being called on to answer a question, afraid of just being spoken to in general, etc. And I was just sad 24/7, also anxious 24/7 the symptoms just got worse when I went to class or something. I was struggling so bad and my mom saw that and set up an apt with my school counselor. I ended up dropping out of some ib courses so I was no longer a full ib candidate for the special diploma. Even though I dropped the majority of my classes (I completed the majority of my credits the year before) the anxiety and depression got worse and I tried to end things thinking I’d be that way forever. I’m better now, have a loving boyfriend and supportive family, but I’m doing nothing interesting with my life. I’m only ever happy when I’m with my boyfriend, it’s like I rely on him for happiness. Of course I want to be happy when I’m with him, but I want to learn to be happy on my own. I want to do something with my life, go to college, pursue architecture/astronomy/oceanography.. the issue is- I haven’t decided what I want to do and I’m just afraid of going back to a school setting because of being unable to handle IB in highschool.

"I cant anymore its annoying and its just irritating
Im scared of asking for help cause the few times I did I got turned down. Avita wont call me back or even let me schedule then theres raising my child on my own. I have depression meds and thyroid meds and sleeping meds but even then nothing works. I feel like screaming so loud that the world around me will stop. I love my child with everything I have but she was a unconsent baby. I dont believe in abortion for myself idc if any other woman does. I dont believe in giving a child up for adoption cause what happens if I cant have another. Shes 2 and I have dwelled on the fact that her pos father threatened to take her away from me if I tried to get him for child support in which he cant figuring me and 2 other family members have restraining orders on him. Mine ended last year in which i did let him meet her. The few times he has seen her she would scream and want me. So hes not allowed to see her. Last year he got married and this year had his wedding on my birthday. I dont care that he did just wish i knew why he abused me but not his new wife. Then Theres mixed feeling about my current bf who treats me like im a queen and an ex who treated me like shit. I feel like I deserved the mental and emotional abuse he out me through. But I know I dont. I plan on marrying my current boyfriend who spoils my child and treats her like his own. Only difference is im scared. I know its ok to be scared but in all honesty im terrified that one day and I have visualized this that my daughter will come into my room see me curled up on the bed depressed and go to my boyfriend who will be my husband at the time and say ""mom wont get out of bed I guess its another one of those days..."" As if annoyed that i suffer from severe depression. I have yet to have a day where I stay in bed and cry but i have had days where I just cry for no absolute reason cause i honestly cant take it anymore. Then theres my boyfriend who i have been fighting with recently when it comes to his family. I care about his family but his grandmother is sick and has a lung disease and still smokes to cope with his mother who is a drug addict and doesnt care about anyone but herself and im stuck having to watch my boyfriend try his best for his grandmother to get his mothers land to get a place put on it for us just to let his mother who will be drug tested a lot and wont be allowed vistors at the place live with us. I dont want to make it feel like a prison to her and I wanna see her get the help she needs to be healthy and live a long full life for her children and future grandchildren. Me and him both agreed that if she messes up once she will be out but I feel like its wrong to bring her in, in the first place cause i know she will mess up shes human and ive never did drugs but my aunt has... I have so much on my mind that i just want to know how to cope properly im a good 2 weeks clean from self harm and I dont wanna relapse it. I have no friends i can vent to at any time of the day or night, cause my one friend hates hearing me go on and on about being depressed so often and the other one is pregnant and I dont wanna cause her any worry. Than theres my mom who i feel like gets annoyed with me wanting to get actual help cause she says i only have severe depression and anxiety and panic attacks. But when i told her about certain mental illnesses that have similar symptoms that I show and that everyone has noticed she told me straight up ""you dont have it cause its not genetic."" Everything is so stressful i just turned 21 and im not wanting to lead down the path of drinking cause it can honestly make someone a terrible person. My baby daddy was an abusive drunk and my ex would bottle so much shit up than drink and cuss me out.. I cant with alcohol and I just feel like saying f it and just staying to myself like i always do.
I just want my daughter to grow up and say ""my mom may have been fighting battles her whole life but atleast she stayed in the picture and raised me to be the woman I am today."" And I want her to be proud to have me as her mother cause right now i feel like im failing her i feel as though im not doing enough. I dont play with her unless i have a boost of energy or happiness, instead I just change her, feed her, bathe her, and take her to therapy when the days come up or to her doctors and shriners. Im sorry I wrote to much i just needed to let everything out while i could and im sorry.",1,cant anymore annoying irritating im scared asking help cause time got turned avita wont call back even let

One of my closest friends recently sat me down to commit to improving my depression, which I get. Things were okay. 4 days later he told me we talk too much, but everything is okay. When I asked why the sudden shift in communication. Often my friend would be the one to initiate the conversation, call me first or text me first. It was mutual. We both texted random crap throughout the day. 

As I don’t believe I lost a friend, how do I proceed? Do I give space for a few days and see how things play out? Do I say sorry? It’s bugging me of how to fix things.",1,one closest friend recently sat commit improving depression get thing okay 4 day later told talk much everything okay asked sudden shift communication often friend would one initiate conversation call first text first wa mutual texted random crap throughout day believe lost friend proceed give space day see thing play say sorry bugging fix thing,one closest friend recently sat commit improving depression get thing okay 4 day later told talk much everything okay asked sudden shift communication often friend would one initiate conversation call first text first wa mutual texted random crap throughout day believe lost friend proceed give space day see thing play say sorry bugging fix thing

While wrong this - I have felt at peace. Truly believe this is the way to go and the way out. While I know friends will feel bad for a short time. I believe my closer friends will be secretly happy.

"So I’m sure this sorta thing has been posted about on here a million times, but here goes:

Long story short I’ve been depressed basically my entire life, for a variety of reasons. Without going into too much detail about my problems and/or state of mind, I’m sick of feeling like this.

Like many others, I’ve heard that Magic Mushrooms have a lot of potential in helping with Depression. I was planning on tripping sometime around the time my 90 day probationary period at work ends, and I’m able to get insurance and actually see a therapist. I’m not looking at a trip as some sort of “Miracle Cure”, just ultimately 1 of a few steps I’d need to take to help get my mind in the right place and build a better life for myself. I think it could serve as a nice sort of ‘reset’ for my brain, amongst other things. Either way, like I said I’m not expecting even a miracle trip to solve all my problems - I know I’ve got a long, arduous journey ahead of me (in terms of getting my life to where I want it to be).

Note that close to a decade ago I actually had a bad trip on shrooms (I don’t remember the dose) when I was left to trip alone by someone I thought was my friend (who waited ‘till the last second to tell me that he had to leave early because he had to work the next morning). I was heartbroken over a relationship that had ended earlier that year, had just dropped out of college (with no real career or life plans to speak of), and was feeling depressed and hopeless in general, so I wasn’t in a good state of mind before the trip even started. I don’t remember much about the trip itself, but I remember some heavy anxiety, the walls breathing, and my posters talking to me (it’s pretty demotivating having the frontman from 1 of your favorite bands tell you how much of a loser you are). Starting around the month after that bad trip I started having ‘flashbacks’ (that’s what I’m calling them, even though idk officially what they are): I’d have these around 10-30 intervals of bad anxiety and a bit of derealization, feeling like I was in a bad dream (definitely not enough to qualify as Psychosis (it’s happened over 100x while I was driving, and I was able to keep going with no problems), but enough to be unpleasant). It used to happen 4-6x a day (on days when it did happen), and would automatically fuck up my day. But now I’ve come to realize that it’s just 1 of many things that my brain does to fuck with me (for lack of a better term), and it doesn’t happen too much anymore, Hell I’ve even had plenty of days where it happened early in the day and I went on to have a good enough day. 

Whatever it is, I just wanted to mention it before asking any questions, or having a further discussion. I’m not too worried about the effects getting worse, or it turning into Psychosis or anything like that: It started to get noticeably better around late 2017, and kept on getting better in 2020 - a year filled with anxiety, stress, depression, irregular sleep patterns, all that fun stuff. I think that realization that your brain isn’t always your friend, and will do things to hurt you, was a big turning point for me…...

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

1.) What dosage should I take? Micro Dose? Regular Dose? Heroic Dose?

I’ve heard conflicting reports on recommended doses for ‘psychedelic therapy’. I was thinking of just taking a regular dose, and if it goes well I’d probably take a regular or micro-dose 3-4x a year. Note that while my tolerance isn’t too high, I’m gonna prepare for anything. I’ll be ready for any dose, any sort of effects. I’m not gonna let that bad trip happen again. And I’m gonna have a trip sitter around (obviously).

2.) How does the trip, and trip after effects, last for each dosage I just mentioned (Micro, Regular, Heavy, Heroic Dosage)? 

I’ve heard that no matter what dose, most mushroom trips last around 6-8 hours total - is that true?

3.) Is listening to music while tripping a good idea? 

I have a playlist with around 2.5 hours of positive, motivational, a few spiritual and plenty of relaxing tunes that I was interested in playing during the ‘peak’ of the trip. I was hoping it would help ‘maximize’ the trip (for lack of a better term).

4.) Anything I should know before I trip?

5.) Any tips and/or advice for me?",1,sure sorta thing ha posted million time go long story short depressed basically entire life variety reason without going much detail problem state mind sick feeling

"Hey, I need help currently I’ve been witnessing some fucked up shit! I lost my Girlfriend of Two and a half years, I’ve been fighting with my Family Constantly and had to listen to stuff like „You know what we should’ve smacked you to death as a kid that would of made things easier for us!“ or „Go and never come back you are not worth our time“ from my own mother. I know I know it sounds hard but to be honest I am getting used to it, I mean hey I am 19 years old now and I am a men now! But deep inside I’ve never been happy, I’ve constantly thought about doing stupid stuff to myself, and how much of a weight I am for others in my family. Well and now the men that raised me and loved me like no one ever did is getting dementia…my grandpa my role model my hero my life saver.

"This has become more of a rant and I am not sure if I am allowed to post it like this. I hope someone still answers.

&amp;#x200B;

So I (M 22) have been diagnosed and all and I mostly know what my problem is. Still I have been in an incredibely deep depression hole since July. At the beginning of this year I tried to get back into therapy and I actually spoke with a therapist and a psychiatrist about medication and further therapy. In May I was put on some antidepressants and I was going to this one therapist twice a month. But I stopped using the medication regularly and mostly out of shame I did not speak to the psychiatrist again. Also the therapist was not really helping me in any significant way. I know that I should then search for a new one, but I thought I wasnt doing that bad and I never really felt something from the antidepressants, so I just let it die down. Sadly that was a bad decision, because as soon as life got a bit ""difficult"" again (I had to do stuff for university) I just started shutting down. Not getting up in the morning, missing classes and other appointments, not opening important letters, not paying my bills and this just became worse and worse since the beginning of July. Then I also lost a huge part of my support network, because the people I was living with moved away and since August I dont have a job anymore. For two months now every day looks basically the same: I wake up at some point of the day, I lay in bed for hours, scrolling through social media until I decided to sit at my computer and then at some point in the night get back in my bed where I scroll through my phone until I collapse. This is extremely unhealthy and I shouldnt continue this, but I seriously cant find any motivation to take care of my mess, besides that I keep telling myself that I am not depressed just lazy (which is in light of the diagnosis by several doctors pretty stupid but...) and to top it off I now also lost my health insurance. I am now living with my parents again and I really dont know how to continue. I am supposed to get back to university in two weeks, but I dont even know if they want me there anymore (because obviously I did not take care of my papers and I am to scared to contact my professors). Also (and which is probably the worst of all these things) my concentration is completely broken. I have to flood my brain with stimuli or else I feel like going insane from anxiety, self deprecating thought, nervousness and suicidal thoughts. This is also what makes reading letters and other similar tasks (not to speak of writing my papers or actually searching for a new job) just so difficult, because I have to give it my full attention. 

Long story short I really need help, but I am not sure what kind of. My past experience with therapy was not the best (3 differen methods, 5 different therapists) and I have the feeling I am not really depressed and just blowing everything out of proportion because I am to lazy.",1,ha become rant sure allowed post like hope someone still answer amp x200b 22 diagnosed mostly know problem still incredibely deep depression hole since july beginning year tried get back therapy actually spoke therapist psychiatrist medication therapy may wa put antidepressant wa going one therapist twice month stopped using medication regularly mostly shame speak psychiatrist also therapist wa really helping significant way know search new one thought wasnt bad never really felt something antidepressant let die sadly wa bad decision soon life got bit difficult stuff university started shutting getting morning missing class appointment opening important letter paying bill became worse worse since beginning july also lost huge part support network people wa living moved away since august dont job anymore two month every day look basically wake point day lay bed hour scrolling social medium decided sit computer point night get back bed scroll phone collapse extremely unhealthy shouldnt continue seriously cant find motivation take care mess besides keep telling depressed lazy light diagnosis several doctor pretty stupid top also lost health insurance living parent really dont know continue supposed get back university two week dont even know want anymore obviously take care paper scared contact professor also probably worst thing concentration completely broken flood brain stimulus else feel like going insane anxiety self deprecating thought nervousness suicidal thought also make reading letter similar task speak writing paper actually searching new job difficult give full attention long story short really need help sure kind past experience therapy wa best 3 differen method 5 different therapist feeling really depressed blowing everything proportion lazy,ha become rant sure allowed post like hope someone still answer amp x200b 22 diagnosed mostly know problem still incredibely deep depression hole since july beginning year tried get back therapy actually spoke therapist psychiatrist medication therapy may wa put antidepressant wa going one therapist twice month stopped using medication regularly mostly shame speak psychiatrist also therapist wa really helping significant way know search new one thought wasnt bad never really felt something antidepressant let die sadly wa bad decision soon life got bit difficult stuff university started shutting getting morning missing class appointment opening important letter paying bill became worse worse since beginning july also lost huge part support network people wa living moved away since august dont job anymore two month every day look basically wake point day lay bed hour scrolling social medium decided sit computer point night get back bed scroll phone collapse extremely unhealthy shouldnt continue seriously cant find motivation take care mess besides keep telling depressed lazy light diagnosis several doctor pretty stupid top also lost health insurance living parent really dont know continue supposed get back university two week dont even know want anymore obviously take care paper scared contact professor also probably worst thing concentration completely broken flood brain stimulus else feel like going insane anxiety self deprecating thought nervousness suicidal thought also make reading letter similar task speak writing paper actually searching new job difficult give full attention long story short really need help sure kind past experience therapy wa best 3 differen method 5 different therapist feeling really depressed blowing everything proportion lazy

"Ive been struggling with severe depression and anxiety and bipolar disorder ever since I was diagnosed from a psychiatric hospital after attempting to take my life 3 years ago. Ever since I began my relationship w my bf of almost two years now, we have been together almost every single day and became my best friend for everything first. Throughout the pandemic we even ended up practically living at each other’s places and I developed separation anxiety being apart from him. He has moved to college in august, and the first day I made a mistake driven by my anxiety and worst thoughts possible. He was questioning where I was when I had met up with a friend of mine to catch up and tell her about my bf moving away for school and everything. I don’t know why I became so panicked and automatically thought me telling him the truth was going to cause him to leave me. In that moment I decided to hide the fact that I was out before when he already knew the truth and in turn made me look very very bad. This event has caused him to not speak to me at all since late August and I have become extremely lost and heartbroken over no communication with someone I’ve been best friends with and living together for almost two years. I become too afraid to push communication thinking it might run him off the wrong direction but I’m starting to miss exams and even failing and the amount of times I’ve painfully sobbed thinking how just before august I would at least have him here next to me. I feel like he’s given up on communication and when I confront him about it he says he avoids talking to me because he’s uncomfortable receiving help from me and has been overwhelmed on his end with school specifically. He’s recently a few days ago answered finally and agreed to talk with me but made it known he has mixed feelings for me and still doesn’t know about us,  it’s one or two texts a day meanwhile I’m telling him of my struggle with school and panic attacks over being in a what seems to be horrible position. However, when he reached out for help when he was having panic attacks over feeling homesick and lonely at school the first week he was able to talk to me more normally and frequent. Ever since he stopped struggling with finding friends there that’s when he disappeared and wouldn’t even bother responding or checking in on me for two (almost three) weeks it made me rlly concerned because he knows I struggle a lot mentally and I would’ve thought he was worried about me hurting myself or something. It really affects my ability to focus with school and at work as well, I often have bursts of panic attacks when I’m sitting at the front desk.

"Hey all. I’m turning to you because... I’m not sure where else to go.

I’m living in Melbourne, Australia at the moment. Getting help is tougher than I ever imagined. Mental health organisations are overworked and understaffed. Therapy sessions are far from affordable. And I am holding on to my last string. To be honest, I have been for some time.

My whole life, I’ve felt undesirable and worthless. I don’t see much value in myself or what I do, and I never have. I constantly feel like a waste of space. It has me thinking: is life really worth living this way?

I met someone who made me feel otherwise... at least for a while. But the honeymoon phase is long over and as he retreats back into his shell of commitment-less comfort, I melt into a puddle of misery.

Perhaps it’s because I know the one thing I’m unequivocally good at is **loving someone else**.

So maybe I should learn to love **myself** instead. But how do I do that when I can’t see any value in myself?

"Depression should really be called lethargy.  Sadness can be a side effect, but this is the core issue.

The key that I found after many years:

Short term relief: close eyes and breathe deeply (in and out) and quickly for 5 or 10 mins (sitting down).  You can pass out, so always do in a safe setting, not in water or driving.

Long term: exercise, but it takes months which isn’t why many get discouraged and quit before reaching clarity.

Because I really don't deserve it, I'm just a disappointment

Having this issue is a disaster, I want to protect everyone by kill myself but maybe it would be worse. I hate me, I only bring problem to someone else, I'm stupid and a fucking burden to my parents.

Wait, did you ask me that I have better life than you so why I have to feel like this?

oh you idiot, I'm a worst student ever and my teacher have to yell at me A LOT, I'm a reason why my mom depressed, a worst child ever for being mean to my grandparents.

You thought that was it? I almost kilked my grandmother. What do you think? Am I worse than you? Of course yes, I'm the worst.

"A friend of mine is suffering from what I think is severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Unfortunately, she lives in a different country with her family, who are extremely conservative and would not allow her to seek help. Not to mention that they are the major causes for her depression (body shaming, making her generally feel less than, and just generally making her feel trapped).

"I created this Reddit account just so I can find some help for my mental health.

Back story: the usual gifted kid burnout, anxiety, depression, ptsd, &amp; bpd diagnosed, taking meds, &amp; too broke for therapy the last few months. 

I have been diagnosed with all of these illnesses in 2017, when a major event led to everything I ever suppressed coming to the surface like a volcano. 

I don’t want to talk about my past a lot, bc I am already living in it, but an overview for context: I was the hardest working person you could ever meet, got many awards throughout my academic career, learned 4 languages fluently, started learning two more in college, got accepted into my dream university (one of the top uni’s in the country), &amp; have a boyfriend right now.

Currently: I’m (23F) losing everything I ever worked for. So much trauma was added to my life while I was already trying to work through a previous trauma, and now I feel like I will never get better. I feel broken, empty, I feel like a used up human being, I feel like I should be discarded at this point. How can I be so fucked up, and still have the ability to go on about my life? The only reason i kept going before is because I had literally convinced myself that I can ignore my problems if I don’t address them (I was a child and didn’t know better). I’m addressing them now but I feel like it was better before because I could cling on to some kind of hope that it will be okay. Now with everything on the table, and everything else that’s being added to the table, I don’t see how I could ever be okay or functional again. 

I just want someone to tell me how to make myself start living again, how to make the first step. How can I function?

I even made a plan to get my life back on track, I tried taking small steps, I tried taking big steps, I tried everything and I can’t get better, I get disappointed in myself when I fail and that makes things worse than before I even tried whatever thing I failed at. 

If it’s not obvious, I also really don’t know how to love myself. The only reason I am even asking for help is because I don’t want to lose my boyfriend. He is an angel that was sent to me by all the gods collectively (maybe as an apology for the tragedy that is my life), but I can’t watch him love me and suffer bc I’m suffering anymore. I feel like he deserves better, and even though he assures me that the effort I’m making to get better is more than enough, I just feel guilty because he didn’t sign up for this when we got into this relationship. I also wasn’t this fucked up when we got together. Please no one bash him he is so compassionate and empathetic he would never say anything to make me feel bad about my mental illness. 

I accepted losing everything I ever cared about, my career (was supposed to go to law school but I still didn’t even graduate undergrad - took a leave), my family (abusive so good riddance I guess but that still hurts), my friends (I seem to only make friendships with selfish people, which is why now that I’m not okay I am finding myself alone), I accepted even losing my physical healthy and even myself, but god please I can’t lose my partner. If anyone thinks that getting better for myself is what I should be thinking, believe me I know.  But right now, I care about my boyfriend more because he was there for me when no one else was even when I wasn’t there for myself, and he deserves better from me. I care about him more than I care about me because that’s what I’m capable of right now, if I could love myself believe me I would. 

Please tell me how to get better, how to get out of bed and do something productive for once, I was a workaholic I don’t know what the problem is right now. I get one email and feel like my world is crashing around me.

"I hope this is okay but I have almost a whole case of pork flavor oriental style instant noodles. I have 15 spicy and 11 regular pork flavor. I think they are both sort of spicy but there’s multiple spice and chili packs that you can use in them. 

This is the brand and the flavor I have:
https://www.amazon.com/MAMA-Instant-Oriental-Noodles-Flavor/dp/B07RQBTCGQ

The catch is that we bought these in bulk as my partner is a super picky eater and he liked them, the thing is he stops liking things after he eats them for a few months and he has touched them in a while. The best sell by date is dec of 2020 for the spicy packs and June of 2020 for the regular pork. They were stored in a cool dry pantry and I honestly probably would eat them (the worst that could be wrong is stale noodles?) except i don’t like this flavor(I like the Tom yum flavor but the pork is too much for me.) Before I throw it away I figured I’d offer it. I’m not trying to be insulting to people in need, from what I can tell these are actually sort of cult favorites in the instant noodle community 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t like to waste something someone may want or use. 

If this isn’t appropriate let me know or if there’s someplace else this would fit I’d appreciate the information.

"My fiance and I were blindsided on Sunday when we were in an accident that may or may not have totaled my car (insurance is saying it's totaled based on photos, but still has yet to inspect the car.)

"Hi all…a year and a day ago I was at a really low point. I felt helpless and didn’t know how I was going to dig my way out to the other side of the hole I was in and this sub came through with some groceries and necessities. The groceries are long gone, but the feelings of hope, gratitude, support, and reminder of goodness in the world has stayed close to me since. I was really truly blown away by the generosity of strangers here. I have kept all the gift notes that came with your purchases on my altar and have been sending you thanks and good vibes (if you’re into that).  

I am happy to say this year has been a lot better for myself and partner, and I’m in a good place where I am able to pay it forward—I’ve done so outside of here (shoutout to my local free fridges) but I would really like to do so directly on this sub too!

My wife and I are in a bind, and would be extremely grateful for any help.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been very ill (we still don't know what from) for the past two years. Because I didn't have insurance, it has taken a very long time to get in to see doctors and specialists because we had to save for the fees while living on only my wife's disability payment. I finally qualified for Medicaid in the past two months, so I have more appointments set up.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is disabled and unable to drive because of it. My health has gone downhill pretty quickly the past six months. Right now I am in a very bad patch, and as such can't climb the stairs down to be able to drive. When this has happened in the past, our daughter would pick up grocery orders and deliver them for us.

&amp;#x200B;

However, right now my daughter, sister, and step-father (the only family we have) are all down with COVID-19. Since my wife can't drive and I can't get to the parking lot, we're in a bit of a pickle. The check is gone, and we can't get to a food pantry or anything, so supplies are wearing thin.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to choose items that are shelf stable and will stretch into many meals, as I don't know when I'll be able to drive again, and our family (once well) lives in another town. Amazon can be stupid expensive, but I tried to get the cheapest items I could find.

&amp;#x200B;

Any assistance you can offer would be such a blessing.

"Hi everyone. I just got the results back of a celiac panel and my gastrointestinal doctor is recommending that I go gluten free immediately. Unfortunately we have used up our food stamps for the month. (I thought we were going to get some extra pandemic food stamps deposited but we never got it.)

We have staples like beans, tuna and rice. I am really needing help with snacks for work and things for breakfast. I am also lactose intolerant so no dairy items. I have a gastric delayed emptying issue and I need to eat every 2 hours to keep it in check. This is why most of my items are snack like. 

 Just hoping someone is willing to help out with a couple things. Thank you in advance for reading!

Hey guys! Sorry it’s been so long since my last post here, but I sincerely hope everyone is doing as well as possible. If you’re having trouble and need some help, comment your anonymized address Amazon grocery list. 

Unfortunately, my past experiences on this sub have taught me that the most efficient way to help as many people as I can is to trust the moderators to vet the requesting parties and to follow the rules of the sub. Please do not DM me if you are ineligible to post here. I am very sorry. 

In your comment please mention something you’ve recently been proud of, or liked yourself for, even if it is small. :) 

I would ideally like to help as many people (and beloved pets!) as much as I can. 

Big hugs and I hope this can bring a little relief. Stay safe!

"Hello,

I’m really nervous to post this because I’ve never asked for food help before, but my wife and I are struggling right now. She doesn’t start her new job for two weeks, and I’ve just spent the last of our paychecks on rent and medical bills from a procedure I had for my chronic illness. 

If anyone has the ability to help us get through the next two weeks until I get paid and she starts her job, we would so very much appreciate it. In my wish list I’ve tried to select things that will last a while and that aren’t too expensive. Anything at all would just be so so greatly appreciated. I’m so ashamed but we really do need the help. I plan to pay it forward when I’m in the position to. 

Here is a link to my wishlist: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/29MO3QLFU1KBK?ref_=wl_share

It was really hard to find individual items that weren’t via Amazon Fresh (which I couldn’t add to the list), so I completely understand if some of these bulk items aren’t doable. 

If anyone can help, I would be extremely grateful.

EDIT: The list has been taken care of. Thank you so much to you all. I can’t even begin to express my gratitude. I promise that I will pay it forward when we’re on our feet.",0,hello really nervous post never asked food help wife struggling right start new job two week spent last paycheck rent medical bill procedure chronic illness anyone ha ability help u get next two week get paid start job would much appreciate wish list tried select thing last expensive anything would greatly appreciated ashamed really need help plan pay forward position link wishlist http www amazon com hz wishlist l 29mo3qlfu1kbk ref_ wl_share wa really hard find individual item via amazon fresh add list completely understand bulk item doable anyone help would extremely grateful edit list ha taken care thank much even begin express gratitude promise pay forward foot,hello really nervous post never asked food help wife struggling right start new job two week spent last paycheck rent medical bill procedure chronic illness anyone ha ability help u get next two week get paid start job would much appreciate wish list tried select thing last expensive anything would greatly appreciated ashamed really need help plan pay forward position link wishlist http www amazon com hz wishlist l 29mo3qlfu1kbk ref_ wl_share wa really hard find individual item via amazon fresh add list completely understand bulk item doable anyone help would extremely grateful edit list ha taken care thank much even begin express gratitude promise pay forward foot
"Hello to all of you,
I have never asked for anything before, but this pandemic has finally broke us.

My husband and I are over 60, we both lost our jobs early 2020, only one of could get unemployment, and now that is gone.  My husband is a 24 year US Navy veteran, and he does get a retirement, which we are very grateful for. That pays some bills but not all.  I have applied for Snap, then missed deadline for paperwork,  I didn't get a benefit letter for Navy in time, so now I'm just waiting as I did give it to them when I received it, they say up to 30 days.  

But, now my husband and I found out that my adult son who did not get vaccinated () just found out he's positive.  My husband and I are both vaccinated, however,  we both have low grade fever 99.5-100.5, and have sinus issues and dry cough.  We are getting tested tomorrow, either way we have to quarantine.  

I don't know what to do, so for the first time in my life I am asking for help from the kindness of strangers, who are angels in disguise. 

Thank you so very much for you help and kindness. 

I was able to go to a food pantry drive thru today, and I am very grateful.  I got bag of rice, two dozen eggs, grapes and a bag of cereal.  Hoping for more but very thankful, but I will need more.  

I don't shop Amazon for food it's always seemed expensive, so I don't know where the cheap stuff is, I would appreciate your help with that.  I have a wish list but all I have added still seems expensive, so whatever anyone can help with on my list or off will be greatly appreciated. I can't find cheap soup!

Also, my wish list keeps duplicating, and I delete them but pops up again.  I don't know why it's doing that so please ignore duplicates as I am not asking for double!

"Hi there everyone!! 

I just wanna say that this is my first time asking for help on a sub like this and I’m not keen on asking for help usually from anyone. But at this point I do really need some help, at least with groceries…

To put things basically, I was in a car accident a few months ago and my car was totalled. (not my fault btw) I lost a lot of time from work and have had physical issues since then and dealing with it on top of everything else has really ramped up my mental issues. Ive been struggling to recover since then both emotionally and physically cause I ended up back in the ER again last month for my back, so fun !!! 🙃 

Though yeah ive been struggling to get back on my feet since then. Ive fallen behind on bills and everything is just a mess right now. Everything has been a struggle to finance and I’m asking for some help now until I can finish up my physical therapy and get the payment from insurance but that could take a whileeeee. Thank you guys for even taking the time to look at these requests and everything!!! Thanks for reading this one too :’)

"Hello there. This is my first time posting on a subreddit like this, so pardon me if it sounds a bit awkward.

I'm posting to request help with our groceries. My family and I don't have much left in our kitchen, and our food card won't be refilled until next month. My brother works a lot and doesn't have much time or money to go to the store, and my mother can't work at all due to health problems. We're trying not to spend too much money, as we're saving up to (hopefully) get a new house (we were forced to move out of our old one, and are now living in this crappy leased house).

There's not a lot on my list, just some ingredients I can use to make chicken soup, a drink, and some easy snack stuff we can put into my brother's lunch. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please and thank you. &lt;3

"Hey guys, i'm just reaching out to this sub for assistance in feeding myself this month. I'm high functioning Autistic, as well as ADHD and Major Depressive Disorder, so it's extremely difficult for me to find suitable jobs that work with my disabilities and mental deficits. Beyond my disabilities, this past year has been a mess of family struggles, including the divorce of both my parents, helping my mom cope and return to normal, and getting my dad to (attempt to) go to rehab. That's all on top of the worldwide struggle that was 2020 as a whole. 

I know my situation is far from great, but I really struggle with properly asking for help. I am desperately applying for jobs right now and just trying to earn enough to make my rent every month. I've burned through all my savings, and am starting to donate plasma for some money, but for the next week or two I am just scared since I don't have any source of income at the moment.

I've never done grocery shopping online so forgive me if anything is strange, but I tried to avoid adding anything frivolous or excessive. Any help is appreciated, so don't feel obligated to buy everything on the list or anything, I was just adding what seemed reasonable.

EDIT: Holy shit, I posted this worried it might take a while to get a response, but you guys have showered me with help in no more than a few hours. Seriously, I can't even express how thankful I am. You guys are amazing. When I can, I hope to pay it forward here on this sub once i'm in a better place financially.

"Like a lot of people, we still haven't fully recovered from the pandemic. We've been able to cut back on nearly everything and we're just barely making it until some recent car and health expenses. We aren't going to be able to figure out the car stuff for a while, but our fridge and pantry are both empty and I'm desperately trying not put money into that when bills are stacking up. We're just needing some things to help us get by for a while until we can figure something else out.

[Edit: Here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/20GQTUGBX2TIQ?ref_=wl_share) is the working (hopefully) Amazon link. Some of the cold items weren't available without Prime, so I swapped in some pantry stuff instead that works just as well for us.

"Hello reddit!

First, nice to meet you and thank you for being amazing!

I'm a freelance content marketer and my work has been hit pretty hard by the pandemic.

My primary employer stopped responding to my messages several weeks ago and I haven't received payment from them in over a month now. My backup employer has been delaying payment on my last invoice, so I haven't received income from anyone at all in 5+ weeks. I'm the only income earner due to my husband's health, so I'm beginning to sweat.

We had savings (yay stimulus!), but it's gone after trying to keep up on our bills with no income. Our pantry stockpile is depleted. At this point, I have to swallow my pride and look for help, because it's getting dire.

I've already applied for social services and contacted food pantries in my county. Now I'm waiting and continuing to look for resources.

Since learning about this sub, I made this Walmart wishlist:

**For shipping:

For same day pickup at our local Walmart:

**Amazon wishlist:**

[**https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1ARO6ZHVF9Z2R**](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1ARO6ZHVF9Z2R)**?**

There are a few baby items (diapers/wipes/snacks) on there and toilet paper, also protein drinks for my husband who has UC and struggles to keep weight on. The shelf-stable coconut milk is for my son, who can't drink dairy or soy.

**THANK YOU** for operating this sub. This is so hard, but now I have hope that we can at least eat (and have clean butts) until work comes in again.

Also: I would LOVE to work again ASAP. I already have one kind employer (found on reddit) in the pipeline.

"Hello! I hope today finds you well. It's been a rough few months for me. Full disclosure, I did receive some wonderful help back in November, and I am eternally grateful for that! Thank you, mystery helpers! But since then, things have taken a turn for the worse. On December 2nd, my mother died suddenly of pulmonary heart failure and left my younger brother and I devastated. I've been trying to get back to my old self, but it's been very difficult because my mother and I were very close (spending every day just a few feet away from each other close).

To top things off, she was the name on our EBT case. They registered that she died and cut our benefits pretty promptly, but that was not a big problem for us. The problem was that they would not let us renew under her name and we had to submit a new case. But we couldn't do it too early, because we were still on her case. In March our benefits were running out so I did the application and in a few days I checked it and saw that it said Approved. But when we didn't get a new card in the mail, I went and checked it again and it said Processing. I'm currently in the process of trying to call them and get things straightened out, but I have no idea how long that will take. Stupidly, I have already spent our stimulus money on getting all of our bills caught up (I had gotten really far behind because of covid and my mother's death), because I didn't think we were going to have a problem.

If you can help me in any way, thank you so much. If all you did was read, thanks for taking the time of day. Here is my list. If it says its been purchased already, its OK to purchase again, a lot of the stuff is the same as it was in November!

My Amazon List: [https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/genericItemsPage/3SQ8BJXOGF0HO](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/genericItemsPage/3SQ8BJXOGF0HO)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: It's Saturday night now and my EBT card still hasn't come up. I got a letter in the mail saying my benefits were denied but on the website it says they were approved. On Monday I'll call again. MEANWHILE! Thank you to everyone who purchased something for me. My brother and I are immensely grateful!

"My boyfriend and I (both 20) live together in north Texas (76207) where we were recently hit with a snowstorm pretty hard as you may have heard by now. We haven’t had a lot to eat since the storm hit us. We were already low on food before the storm hit because my boyfriend’s new job wouldn’t deposit his paycheck which was the money that was going to pay for our groceries. He aged out of foster care about four years ago and as a result was not given much identification documents besides his birth certificate and his social security number, but not the actual social security card. Evidently this wasn’t enough identification for the company he was working with before the storm hit because they told him that they wouldn’t be able to deposit his checks anymore due to identification issues.

The snow storm hit when he lost his source of income, and it prohibited our abilities to find him a new job for over a week. Since we were already running low on food, we won’t be able to eat anything for longer than we anticipated. Right now we could really use groceries to last us until my boyfriend is able to get his next paycheck again.

Luckily I will be getting a raise which will be first applied to my paychecks on April 1st which will hopefully get us on a better track if worst comes to worst. We still haven’t been able to pay this months electricity or rent and our electricity was due to be shut off tomorrow, but fortunately we were able to call electric and they will now be giving us until the middle of March until they turn it off. Any groceries we can collect until my boyfriend is able to receive a paycheck will also help us have room to start paying our rent, electric and some other utilities.

Here’s our wish list. [Amazon wish list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3PTOBMR0I7HM9?ref_=wl_share)

Also. if you happen to know anything about gaining healthy weight, I have been losing a lot of weight that I am scared could get dangerous as I’m already a small person to begin with. Our money problems and then the storm have been making it hard for us to eat properly lately. Whereas I used to be 110 pounds which was the healthiest I’d ever been, I lost unfortunately lost over fifteen pounds and currently weigh about 95 pounds on a good day. Depression is also a factor in my weight loss as well though. But I tried to add some food items that I thought could help me with this to the wish list.

I am a disabled 63 year old woman and am fortunate that I own my home and that my daughter pays my monthly bills while I wait to be approved for SSD. Because I recieve my healthcare from the V.A. my prescriptions and medical expenses are free.

Three spinal surgeries in less than three years have left me in chronic pain and disabled and home bound. I have depleted my savings. Even though I qualify for SSD and have the points, I recently had to appeal with the help of an attorney. Meanwhile, I unfortunately have to ask for assistance to get by.

"##CLOSED! I have chosen THREE users: u/AmeliaKitsune ($50ish Kroger Grocery order via Instacart) u/graavyboat ($50 Walmart Gift Card via e-delivery) and u/RunTellDat1 (has not yet contacted me will update when fulfilled) as the recipients of the grocery giveaway! I will work with them throughout the day to fulfill their orders and update with their choice of stores and means of obtaining groceries as I do. Thank you to the mods and everyone else for their birthday wishes! 



Sunday is my birthday! I hate celebrating my birthday as is, but especially during this pandemic.... I know those second round of stimulus checks have hit, but for some of you out there I realize feeding yourself and your family is still a struggle. Let me share my Real Life Cake Day by buying around $50-ish in groceries for TWO Redditors in need via Amazon, Instacart, Walmart or Target. Pick up or delivery, your choice, but please note, some options require me to know a valid name that can be presented via ID for the store pickup of choice, so if you choose this method, please be ok with supplying that for me. NO CASH transfers, food only. 

##RULES:

*Must meet all criteria for this sub including account age and karma count.

*Must NOT have received/won something significant via this sub or similar subs within the past month. Consideration for small items or wins, especially if they were NOT food or cash.

*Will also include some food for the furbabies as well if needed as these are our family too!

*US only!

*Must be in real and genuine need.

*Bonus points for sharing any unique pandemic birthday party stories to brighten my day!

"I just got a real name but my guess is that it was from the offer where I commented, thank you very very very much, my mom's diapers are covered for a long while, thank you so much, I'm out of words and lightheaded.

I'm usually very turned off in terms of my emotions but I feel extremely overwhelmed and ecstatic right now, I dont even know how to react, I've been running around the house accommodating the stuff that came in the package, diapers, rice spices, shampoo, a razor for my hobo beard, more diapers, even a brush to remove dog hair that I had in my list from almost a year ago! I really have no words, I was only wanting a little bit of help getting diapers for my mom and you went way beyond what I had asked, i did secretly wish for a bit more but never thought that I'd get all. I feel like crying but the tears wont come out, I've been crying a lot last week but this time it's from being happy and overwhelmed by your kindness, even after I got into a little argument with one of the mods in my comment, I really had given up hope and was already planning on how to get to the end of the month without diapers.

Thank you very much, your kindness has touched my life and I am feeling a warmth that I had not felt in a long time.

After how horrible things have gone this month especially, thank you for giving me a time to breathe and lay down a little bit not having to worry and stress over all the expenses I have to cover.

And i have learned a bit about myself through this experience, I'm a videogame addict and I've been going through withdrawal after I broke my computer last week, I will try to control it better and if/when I get another computer i will try to control my addiction a little better, I will stop participating in the game subreddits, I will still use videogames as my escape whenever I get the chance but I will do it in a more conscious and controlled manner.

Thank you so much!

Happy new year!

I know I'm not any special case, many people around the world are doing worse off, especially nowadays. My unemployment ran out months ago and I just had a major car repair bill that absolutely drained me. My cat has expensive tastes, he refuses to eat any other wet food but the pouches of stew! Those cost around a dollar a pouch, I love him though so its worth it. I really want to upgrade his dry food to something besides meowmix, but can't afford it right now. I have been living off bean soup I make for the last few weeks, I make a mean soup, but running out of beans!

Anyway, I'm not sure if Amazon Pantry is allowed, so I added some pantry and some non-pantry stuff. I'm not asking for a lot, just a little help.

Thanks so much.

"I’m hesitant/embarrassed to be asking internet strangers for help, but this is one of the only places I could think to go to. I just got kicked out of my dads house and had to move in with my sister for a couple months until I turn 18. Her and her partner already have 2 kids of their own to take care of and at this point we might not be able to buy groceries this week. I would be so, ridiculously grateful for any groceries sent our way. This subreddit seems to be magic sometimes so thank you in advance &lt;3

"UPDATE: My post may have came very late, so far as of noon Thanksgiving Day, I have NOT assisted anyone with food, but I will leave this post up until I fulfill a good supply for a person in need. Will mark as closed once I have helped 🙂






Extremely overworked, healthcare worker, giving up my holiday to work a double shift and help out my residents and my facility while saving my co-workers with children the risk of being mandated this Thanksgiving. Rather than become the soggy sock of the holiday crowd, I felt inspired by something I saw on Reddit and it convinced me I want to help. Looking to BUY a Thanksgiving meal kit to help a family in need get through tomorrow. I know it's a little late in some areas of the US and for that I apologize, but still if I can make a difference and feed a family in need tonight this will make me tomorrow feel so much more fulfilling to me. I am thankful for each and every one of you out there. To the ppl trying their hardest to survive, I have been there too. You and your family will get through these times and sometimes it truly is what you DO have that matters most so don't lose hope.

Rules are just meet the criteria for the sub and please be in real need. I am far from wealthy, but where I lack in funds I DO have an abundance in cares. This is open to at least ONE recepient, but possibly more. Instacart/walmart/target orders for pick up or delivery on the table. I am willing to do a gift card too, but to a grocery establishment only. I will keep this open until I fulfill my offer and exhaust me resources.

Edit: Thank you all. I've been told I can add more to it, but I'm not sure what to add. Right now I'm a little emotional. I didn't really expect much help (don't take that the wrong way, I was already hesitant to ask too) and it sort of just started immediately. I don't think I can add anything else that isn't absolutely overpriced compared to what I would normally pay. I feel like my pantry will be full enough, and I truly hope you all will help the next person just as much.

I may look through Amazon some more and add somethings....but idk. I'm sort of a penny pincher right now. I'm rambling. I need a nap. I've been crying, which I don't do often. Thank you all and God bless you.

"Hello! I recently had to leave my job in a hurry due to many factors. I have another job lined up that it starting this week, but paychecks are every other week so I won't get paid until Nov. 6th.

I am slowly running out of money. I have gas, and I can walk to my job if I need to, and I have plenty of food for my pets. I have an understanding with my landlord that I will pay rent with my first available paycheck, but I am running out of food and basics.

"I'm extremely embarrassed, but I'm requesting enough Kosher food that I can make and eat in my room to get through the next week (I get paid next Thursday, and am starting a new part time work at home job in a call center to help financially the week after that, because this fall has been a crazy mess financially. ) . I had an accident where I needed to borrow the money to go to the urgent care yesterday and also found out that I was exposed to someone in the last several days who has since tested positive for COVID and is now quite ill. As a precaution, I'm trying to remain in my room and away from my roommates, and out of the kitchen and common house areas until I test negative a second time. In any case, I'm broke until Thursday and I feel extremely uncomfortable requesting  an additional loan amount from my lender to have food delivered here that I can take to my room to eat. I also don't think that I'd be able to repay an additional loan amount to him on time even if I requested and added it. Also, I don't have Prime so any food ordered would take a while to arrive.

I went for a COVID test yesterday, and it was negative. I plan to go to retest on Wednesday. 

I requested some ready made meals  (MRE's) so that I can heat them up in my room and have a nice Shabbat meal, otherwise my Amazon  list has pasta, pasta sauce, tuna, crackers, juice, and soup. I have a hot plate, a small pot and a rice cooker to heat items, including to make pasta. 

There's a little extra food items (8 packs of pasta for example) in case it's needed in the future and I run into a situation like this again, so that I can eat at least something. 

I would appreciate any help that could be given. 

Thank you!

"I live in Baltimore, MD (21224)

I just recently moved. It was not a planned move. I ended up struggling to find a job For a few weeks. I finally found one, but it will be 2 weeks before I see a full paycheck. That one will have to go to rent anyways. So it will be a while before I can afford any kind of food. I applied for food stamps, got approved , and before I could even get the chance to use them, someone in chicago did. Apparently someone got ahold of my social security number while I was job hunting through indeed. (We're speculating at least. I can't think of any way else this could of possibly happened.)  They also were able to get my routing and checking number for my bank, and bounced a bunch of checks which left me almost $1000 over drafted. Fortunately, They didn't open any credit cards I my name because my credit is too trash. But they made sure to take what little they could from me. It's all currently being investigated, and as far as my EBT benefits go I'll be receiving a new card with my previous funds redeposited on to it after they investigate more but who knows how long this will take to be resolved. I'm really trying to make things work but I'm really struggling. I have health issues that require me to eat, and I work a physically demanding job. I've been mostly eating once a day, on days I work and that's only if my manager helps me out with a meal. I've never reached out to the internet for help but I don't know what else to do. 

I've tried the food bank but they want utility bills in my name. My utilities are included with rent. The one that did donate to me, gave me a large box of rotten produce. I tried making a gofundme but it got no hits. 

If you've read this far, thank you.

Good evening everyone , I am here trying to go to sleep but I am worried about groceries for my kids. Posting this to ask for some help with food..

I made an Amazon wishlist with some groceries for my family. I am a single Mama in a financial bind. I have been looking for a job for weeks with no luck as of yet.. Like alot of families, mine and my adult daughter’s jobs were lost in June and July due to Covid . My daughter just started work and she won’t get paid for two weeks.. I couldn’t link things like Milk, Cheese, basically fresh foods, but these wishlist items would still help us immensely! I am homeschooling as well, so groceries are going quicker than when the kids were attending school. Please feel free to comment any questions. ANY order, big or small would be a huge help to my little family. Thank you so much for reading! Hope everyone has a good day/night depending on where you live!

"Thank you so much to everyone who sent us groceries!!! I’m so shocked by how much tasty, healthy stuff for my kiddo and I has popped up on our stoop. Thank you for all the lovely notes of encouragement, as well as the surprise of things we didn’t even ask for, and special thanks to the wonderful soul who must have sent us a year’s supply of Gatorade. 

I’m so incredibly grateful for everyone who made the start of my new job so much more comfortable, long days are so much more manageable when I’m able to eat breakfast and pack lunch and then go home and eat dinner too, and then also not end up fighting with my son about how he doesn’t want to eat rice for meal after meal, day after day because he doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t just go to the grocery store. 

I mostly just use Reddit to hang out in the mom subs and the funeral sub, but I am so so thankful and amazed, I found this sub and thought “hey what do I have to lose” with no idea that it would turn out to be such incredible superhero display of kindness and generosity. All y’all really saved my behind. I have enough food now for both of us to last through the next pay period (omg!!!) and I am so excited to be able to work towards having a savings again so we won’t be up the creek if something unexpected happens again, that we’ll at least have money for rent AND food.

Joke references to Notting Hill aside, my son and I could use some help to get us through the next couple of weeks.

I worked at a funeral home, I finished mortuary school recently. I really loved it. I plan to go back to the field later. But right now, it's just not an ok time for me to be doing this work in the pandemic, this is just not the kind of death that I signed up for or am emotionally equipped to handle. It's been a lot of people who are younger, seeing children and teens who've lost parents, people in their 40's being widowed. It's not grandparents or people who had cancer or something, where people were able to make some kind of peace. It was just really, really depressing every day, day after day. It got to a point where I wasn't emotionally dealing with it, and then I was sometimes crying at home.

I found a new job as a case manager and I'm really excited about it, but when I told my boss about the new job he cut me loose on the spot. Which I was NOT expecting. So I ended up missing a little over two weeks of pay from that day until my new job started, and I'm not getting paid for another week. I really waited to think about asking for help because it makes me feel low, but at this point, we're mostly out of food. We have cereal and rice, and I'm down to one meal a day to save food for my kid.

I'll be making more money at this new job than I ever have, and I'm usually really good with money in that I know how to make it stretch real far. I just need to get a couple of paychecks under my belt to be able to get back on my feet, because my smaller than expected paycheck plus all of my savings was only enough to make rent, one load at the laundromat, and put gas in my car to get to work. I try to do right by everyone and put good energy out there to help people whenever I can, so I'm hoping someone can help us out a little.

Thank you &lt;3

"Hello! I really didn't think I'd have to come to this point but sadly I'm at a loss, I'm currently at university in the UK and though I have some money, I have to pay my student accommodation rent soon and my student loan isn't great, it leaves me with less than £15 to pay for food and small essentials for about the next month, I do art commissions but I haven't had any for weeks now so I have no form of income. I also don't have any parental support so I can't really ask anyone for help.

I'd really appreciate if anyone could help, i can't offer much as thanks but in return I could do an artistic digital commission for you! I'd repay you with anything you'd like to be drawn, this account is my art one so feel free to have a gander.

I love this subreddit and it makes me so happy to see people being so generous, I hope one day I can return the favour as best as possible.

The link for my amazon list, I don't feel great about giving to amazon so if anyone can provide an alternative that eould be great! I also apologise if some items are quite expensive on the list, I tried to find the cheapest possible choices but christ is it expensive.

Thank you all so much, if you do purchase anything for me please send me a message with proof attatched and I'll be more than happy to do an art commission for you of any calibre!!

The menu is quite long so I had to take a screenshot, you may need to zoom in since it's so long. You can pick anything from the menu that you want. Also make sure to check the bottom of the menu, as you can order just meat/chicken/fish by themselves if you want.

In the mean time we have burnt through most of our savings and need some items for snacks for our 3 year old and some non-perishables that I can use to stretch what we cook and bake bread to save on store bought. 

Don't know if it's allowed that I can do a service for people who get stuff off the wish list?? But I do art and would totally draw you a pet portrait or digitally an icon for you to use in an online profile in exchange for help!

"I will preface this and say that I (fortunately) do have a job at the moment, however after paying all of my bills/dues this month, I'll be -$450 for the month. This is not accounting any food costs. I accepted my job back in March, but due to COVID-19 I was not able to start until July. During this time, but I didn't have any reliable income so I coasted through on my savings from March-July until I graduated and started working and eventually got my first paycheck towards the end of July. Unfortunately, bills have been hitting me hard each month and I haven't had a chance to catch my breath and start saving any money. To make matters worse, I got into a fender bender last week and will be paying an additional $1400 out of pocket to cover damages to the other car.

I am looking for absolutely *anything* for food. Currently in my pantry I have some basic spices, 2 packets of ramen, crystal light mixer packets, and 10 granola bars. My fridge/freezer has 3 frozen burritos, a half-empty 1/2 gal of soy milk, half an onion, ketchup/mayo/mustard, and 2 frozen breaded fish patties. I can definitely make it through the week with this stock, but my next paycheck is this Friday and all of it is already going towards paying off my current debt, after which I will still be withdrawing an additional $450 from my savings to cover the rest, meaning the next time I may have any money left for groceries will be 2+ weeks from today.

As far as food goes, I am NOT picky and at this point will literally eat anything. I feel absolutely horrible/guilty asking for assistance, especially because even in my current situation I know I'm probably better off than a lot of others. I put down bare bones basics on my wish list, but like I said I will eat anything you are willing to ship. Here is my [amazon wish list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2MAMP7KDM52U6?&amp;sort=default) I'm sorry if I didn't do it right, I don't really understand how the wish list is supposed to work. I am native to the 85224 (Maricopa County, AZ) area and will also drive to meet/pick up bulk food if possible (not sure if that's allowed but I figured I would try anyways).

Thank you for reading and I hope I'll be able to pay it forward eventually when I'm able to finally get a stable standing.

"Hello everyone! Recently came across this sub to do some good in my life. I never thought would be posting an actual need. I am an adjunct professor at a small community college and I also do a lot of technology based, in person contracting instruction. I have a part time job to supplement. Because of covid, my contracting went to zero, and my classes were cancelled. I'm starting back up this fall, and have been living off of whatever i have saved (which ran out a week ago).  I am qualified for unemployment, but have yet to receive a check since May. They have to do extra investigation because of my job status and things have been backlogged.  I call every week and they tell me to wait longer.

I start work on Monday, and I have been surviving on ramen. Spicy beef to be exact. While this is ok, I'm even running low on that. I have kids, and my spare money went to them first food wise. Anything you can contribute would be appreciated, and I promise when I get my backlogged UC I will pay it forward thricefold. 

Any suggestions for remotely healthy and filling snacks and meals is appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.

"EDIT: I’m seriously blown away by all of your generosity and compassion. This last week has really worn me down and I was feeling very low before/when I posted. In a short time you have all reminded me that things can and will get better, and given me a much needed boost to keep moving forward. More than anything I look forward to repaying the same kindness when I am able ♥️ Thank you again from the bottom of my heart and with my whole being!!!  

Hello, I am very humbly posting here making a difficult admission that I could really use some help in this moment and would be incredibly thankful for anything that comes of this.  

My partner used to be the primary breadwinner for us but has been unemployed since COVID started and is ineligible for unemployment/CARES funds (we have tried and are about to try again). Looking hard for odd jobs or steady work, but its been slow and inconsistent.  I have thankfully been employed this entire time, thus ineligible for any benefits, but my old job was very part time and never intended to fully support two people—it was mostly meant to be “extra” to pay off debts faster. I was lucky to find a new job that started in June—my new income covers rent and some bills/food. We have cut back on expenses a lot but we are still very behind on most bills since we were prioritizing eating during those first few months.  

This month has been rough despite my best efforts! I tried to start driving for Lyft in addition to my full time job to make some extra cash and get back on top of things. Two weeks in, someone ended up hitting my parked rental car (thankfully all humans OK), resulting in a $500 charge from Lyft (that I may or may not get back...someday), tying up needed money and shutting down the opportunity for extra cash flow. My own 20yr old car needs a repair I can’t afford at the moment, so going to the grocery store  has also become a 3 mile round trip walk or a favor to ask of someone (or money for a Lyft). The thing that pushed me to the edge this week was our internet company shut our service off because we owe too much. They asked for an amount I don’t and won’t possibly have for a few weeks in order to reinstate service, and I 1000% need the internet to do my internet-based job from home (thankfully I worked out something with a friendly neighbor for the time being).

I feel pretty embarrassed to be struggling this much while also trying so hard, and especially knowing others have it so much worse. I get paid today but most of it is already accounted for rent and overdue bills, leaving  0 for food and necessities for two weeks. It would take an enormous weight off of me knowing we don’t have to worry about eating or having laundry detergent, and help me feel like I can start digging out of this hole that I feel stuck in.

As an extra note, I don’t know if this is allowed but I’m really quite good at all kinds of admin tasks or things that lots of people seem to hate doing, like editing and proofreading, audio to text transcribing, tedious spreadsheet work, etc, and if anyone is needing help with something like that I would be thrilled to offer you some assistance as a gesture of appreciation. Otherwise I promise to pay it forward as I find my footing again.

Tried to pick bulk/cheap things and put priority level on stuff we either need (detergent) or stuff that we could stretch far and would be too heavy for me to walk 1.5 miles with from the store with when I do have the funds for it.

"Hello! I'm a university student from Germany and this month has been a huge struggle. I had to pay both next semesters fee and a huge (false) power bill that probably won't be resolved until next month (could show proof, although that would be in German). Had to pay because otherwise they would have shut my power off the following day, tried to clear it up but to no avail.

Next payday from my student job is 31st of August and I've only 7€ left, from which I need to buy some cat litter today, it won't last over the weekend. My fridge is empty (aside from some soy sauce and some tomatoes) and I've only got a few slices of bread left. I didn't eat much for two weeks.

I feel bad for asking but I need some food for my cats and me. I put an Amazon list together and I'd be incredibly grateful for something to munch on for my cats and me. The cats are more important, though. I'd rather have them something to eat than me. They usually have a huge stock of food, but I burned through it in the last week while eating as little as I could.

Sorry for the sob story. Ask me anything if needed, proof or whatever, and sorry for taking my problems to the internet, I just don't know how to handle the situation.

"This is really awkward to ask for, but I’ve spent my last on hay for my animals (a rescued bun and two guinea pigs) and need the rest of my money to make it to doctor’s appointments. Can someone help me by sending some whey protein powder?

I’m a 25 year old college student who’s about to graduate this month and I’m working on finding a job in my field. However, I had a surgery on my stomach two years ago and developed dumping syndrome sometime in June. I can rarely keep food down, so I have an egg for breakfast (takes me half an hour to 45 minutes to eat it veeery slowly) and then lunch / dinner are usually shakes to avoid dumping. If my stomach feels fine, I can get a couple small meals in, but that’s only possible on my “good days.” 

For those who don’t know what it is, dumping syndrome is when food is released undigested into the intestines and the aftermath is... brutal. Heart palpitations, heartburn, headaches, shakiness, dizziness, and other symptoms. I’ve gone to the ER without knowing what was happening to me, because the symptoms were so severe (it can easily seem like a heart attack). 

I’d be incredibly grateful to anyone who can help me. I’ve been relying on liquid meal replacements to get calories in until doctors can figure out why it’s happening and how to fix it.

Hey everyone 

I want to help someone who’s been personally affected by the recent global issues we’ve been facing. I know many people lost their jobs and houses and loved ones during this and if you’re one of them I am absolutely sorry that you have to go through this. 

I’m a student and can’t do much, but I can offer to pay for your dinner, some supplies for your children, or a 20 euro gift card to a grocery shop or amazon. 

I know it’s not much, but I’m hoping it would mean something to you and your family. 

If you write below and explain your situation, I’ll pick someone and provide the help in the way they prefer within 24 hours. 

Unfortunately I can only pick one person, although I wish I could help a 100.

"I just wanted to thank you all for your support. While I am feeling significantly better, I am still quite sick. I'm still limited as to what I can eat but I'm proud to say that I can eat more than soup . I have more challenges ahead the results from my breast biopsy came back as being precancerous and I will be making with the breast surgeon next week. I was scheduled to have a partial hysterectomy on July 30th which now has to be postponed and I may now have to have my ovaries removed as well because having precancerous cells in my breast places me at risk for ovarian cancer. That's all I spent all of yesterday crying. But I'm doing my best to try to find a silver lining in every situation and admitting to myself that it's okay when I can't because it does just fucking suck sometimes you. My silver lining is that you guys here and in other communities have provided me more support love and encouragement than my family has or even my friends. I struggle with multiple mental health issues as well and you all help to keep me balanced and well enough so that I did not slip back into being suicidal and that is a testament of just how amazing loving , supportive &amp; compassionate and genuine you are. I really felt the love. So thank you for all that you've done to make my life better as well as the life of others. I'm really glad that I joined Reddit. What brought me to  Reddit was the story about the guy who was giving live updates about his wife cheating on him and then I realize how awesome it was so I stayed. I was kind of here and there and then when I got sick and I realize that social media is so toxic and bad for my mental health I decided to spend more time on minutes and it's been very beneficial and good for my mental health.

"Just wanted to say thanks to the kind person who sent me the toilet paper the other day I received a pack of toilet paper which I wasnt able to afford due to the current situation.

Covid at the beginning didnt affect me much more tha I already was being unemployed working little gigs with neighbors, friends and acquaintances since 2019 on June, realistically I started having to work around October 2019 when the money I got from quitting ran out, but the thing is that I was managing to get by and sure, covid slowly started making my source of income less reliable so to speak, there were less people soliciting my services but I was still getting to do stuff every now and again to take care of my 56 year old mom who has alzheimer's and myself but as of late everyone is in stand by, so I'm solicited even less and now I've started to feel the struggle for real.

You know who you and I'm not gonna link your username because I've done than before and I know people can sometimes get unwanted private messages of people asking them for stuff when this kind of posts are uploaded but you have no idea how much weight off my shoulders you've lifted by being able to have toilet paper in the house for the month.

I'm sure we all have started to feel the struggle in one way or another, everywhere and in different ways, in mexico the government couldnt care less about us so there's no unemployment money and the help programs are very obscure sometimes, I managed to get 2 bags of food once for my mom but since then I've been going to government offices asking for support and everytime I'm sent to a different office being told that they dont handle that stuff and that I must go to the next one and the next one and it's really exhausting almost feels like they don't want to help you at all.

Anyway thank you very much for the toilet paper my friend! It's more than I could ask for and more than I deserve for sure!

Hope you all are having a not so hard time and having happy times with your loved ones!

"Hey y'all, I'm in a rough spot due to COVID and a bad landlord. 

I recently had to move out of my place (basically an inlaw apt attached to a house I rented by myself, the 60 yr old owner living in the main home) because my landlord was sexually harassing me and then started calling the cops when I didn't take kindly to his advances. I ended up moving into an apartment that is close to my job.

I found out about a week after moving that I would be taking a $5/hr pay cut on top of not having any commission. I'm in sales and this is where we make most of our money, the hourly is already a barely livable wage in itself. Had I known about the paycut I would have found a cheaper apartment.

Thankfully a friend who just started a new job was able to put in a good word for me and I start my second job tomorrow so I will have enough additional income to cover expenses other than my rent. I'm a vegetarian with diverticulosis and other GI issues so I have very specific things I can eat which makes using a food pantry extremely difficult. I received a few items for my pets from a few kind souls on this sub from another post thar I will be eternally grateful for along with anyone else that is able to help me during this difficult time. I hate asking for help and I'm one to always pay it forward. I created a wishlist for Amazon with a bunch of things I am able to safely eat and I'm hoping that I will be able to make it thru until that first paycheck from the second job comes in. Thank you to anyone that got this far in my rambling, I appreciate your time.

"Hi Friends,


Thanks for clicking. My fiancee has been unemployed for a while and his new jobs keep falling though. He is not getting unemployment and is unable to get unemployment (we tried). He has another job lined up but we are waiting on all his paper work to come in which might take a while. 


I am currently the only one working. I'm trying to find a second job but every place I apply sends me the email ""we have moved on with the application process."" My job pays enough to get the rent and most of the bills but food is here or there.


I'm stressed and I've only got a small amount in my account for the next week and almost no food left in our apartment. Most of that will be used for gas so I can go to work. Oh and my paycheck is going to be short because we had off on Friday (Unpaid)


If you are able to help please do I would really appreciate it.

"You do need to have a debit card (or maybe even one of those reloadable gift cards if that works). Just make sure to cancel the subscription. It’s worth the value of a 3 meal box, so far they are easy to make and I usually stretch the meals by using half an onion/garlic/carrots etc to save for another meal, the pasta dishes end up being a shit ton of food. 

My honest opinion of it, if you want to keep it, is that you’re paying for convenience and I have a baby so it’s convenient right now, otherwise I prefer to cook. With that factored for me it doesn’t end up being too expensive, but it’s expensive for the amount of food that comes with vs what you can get at the grocery store. Sustainability is like 7/10, mostly recyclable but they will send you a single slice of bread in a single use plastic bag lol. And of course lots of single use items like sour cream and sriracha.

"As above, we got hit with COVID-19. One of my girls popped positive just yesterday, we don't know when she was exposed, but she works in food service so it could have been at any point. Symptoms literally showed up overnight. With 5 of us in a 3 bedroom house, there's likely to be another case, so we have been told. We can't even go test til Monday with the holiday weekend. My husband is out of work until the incubation time period passes and he tests clean, with no pay. If he tests positive, he'll get half pay. 



Anyhow. I'm looking mostly for help with ingredients--especially yeast, almond flour, bread mix-ins, and spices/broth stuff. Any health/hygiene is also greatly appreciated, and protein bars are a bonus.



If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it. This year seems to have stomped on all of us, and I can't thank you people enough for just existing. I'm happy to answer any questions.

"I've been on SNAP for 3 years, and always run out near the final week of the month. I never eat out, only cook from home, mostly rice + some veg/protein. I achieved this by buying in bulk from making a 1 hour Subway trek to Chinatown for huge bags of rice and inexpensive ingredients rather than shop at my local grocery stores(in a once-poor-now-high class NYC neighborhood which I've been living in for 35 years, buying food is a huge drain). I haven't been on my trek since Covid, partly because of procrastination, partly because funds are so tight and I feel so swamped and exhausted(I have not even been to the laundromat, only washing in the bathtub by hand). If someone out there could provide a large bag of rice you'd have my gratitude.

I made an amazon wishlist:

https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/24U99F8HFPYVY?ref_=wl_share

The only issue is the price of the shipping appears to be included in these bags. These are much cheaper in person but the only issue is carrying them. So unfortunately the shipping is ""free""(not free). I tried to pick the cheapest large bags of rice on amazon I could find, 10 cents an oz and under. I chose 3 sizes, whatever you're comfortable with. Smaller ones than that are the least economical but I'm totally open to your suggestions if you have any better ideas.

The majority of my wishlist arrived today and the rest will be arriving tomorrow. Seeing all this food gifted to me by complete strangers really brought me to tears. 

The personal notes of encouragement and well wishes attached pushed me over the edge and now I’m crying on my kitchen floor. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. I don’t know how much more I can say it, I’m just awestruck at the generosity and kindness. I’ve been feeling really alone in the world since the death of my fiancé last March and knowing that there is always help and a kind word out there, if you ask, is the best possible feeling.

"Hello everyone! My partner and I have been unemployed since the beginning of March and we’re waiting on the application to go through, but our state is still waiting to approve independent contractors. My partner is immunocompromised so we’ve been trying to be really careful and self quarantine. We don’t have any family for 4000 miles or friends because we just moved here so I could escape my family who’s in a cult. Our apartment complex has offered payment plans, but they’re expecting hundreds to be paid every two weeks until our balance is met, so we had to use my partner’s stimulus bills to make things meet. 

I just found out that another user on the pet food subreddit generously gave my four rescues cats enough food for two months and other items. So I know that I have been helped by the kindness of online strangers and I don’t want to ask for more, but we’re running really low on food. I hope this is allowed because I have received help with cat food and toys within the month. And another kind reddit user got me conditioner and body wash last month. 

We’ve really cleaned our pantries and my partner is low fodmap, and allergic to dairy and gluten so it’s been hard for us because food is generally more expensive. They can go into anaphylactic shock from any kind of pepper, including black pepper, so we haven’t been able to receive frozen prepared foods from the food bank and other local orgs. 

I have two chicken breasts, half a bag of carrots, and thankfully some rice I managed to get before everything happened. I’m waiting on food stamps to be processed and the local food pantries don’t have diet options like gluten free, but I can manage to get a pack of chicken or pork from them a week so we ratio it out as best as we can. I’m really hoping that our applications get processed within a week or two, but we’re already down to eating one actual meal a day and some carb/snack for breakfast. The stores next to us are a bit wiped so it’s even hard to find eggs and cheap produce, but we’re already low on funds. 

I added an amazon wishlist with a diversity of food items because things keep going out of stock and I tried my best to get healthy and filling options like nuts. I added different types of flours because it’s cheaper than buying it premade (premade ones keep going oos too) usually and some cocoa butter and powder to make our own snacks and granola bars. I added some shampoo and tampons too, but I know that they’re not food items. I don’t like that speciality items are a lot more expensive and I try to make everything to cut down costs. I’m not GF or non dairy so I usually eat spam, beans, and rice so my partner can have gluten free items available. But I can usually find those canned items for me at the food bank when they’re stocked. 

I attached my wishlist and I’m not sure if gift cards are allowed, but I would happily accept any as well because a lot of food items are cheaper in store and I have asian grocery stores that are actually very well stocked. (Uwajimaya, h-mart, winco, walmart, Fred meyers, Costco, trader joe, qfc, and safeway are nearby). 

TLDR: my partner and I are unemployed and waiting for food stamps and UE apps to be processed, but we’re running low on food. My partner is immunocompromised and have quite a few food allergies and intolerances so we’re finding it really hard to get the items we need in local stores and if they do have it, it’s so pricey that we can only get small amounts of it or at all.

"I will put the list first if you would prefer to be spared of the details of my situation. Will also add a TL:DR at the end.

[My wish list](https://www.amazon.com.mx/hz/wishlist/ls/3TGJTIYSH8XXO?ref_=wl_share#) feel free to ignore the rest of the stuff, I'm eventually gonna get there , I'm planning on using it as a shopping list myself.


Now the details. I'm 26 year old, in october 2018 my father passed away, he used to take care of my mom who was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease since 2016. On June 2017 I had to return home after breaking up with my girlfriend, fortunately or unfortunately. Because breaking up with her allowed me to move back home and help with taking care of my mom who was starting to be really confused about almost everything.

After 6 months of mourning my breakup I got a nightshift job which was very convenient because I could work the nights and come back home in the morning to feed my mom, check that she was drinking water and take her to potty to do her stuff, in June 2019 the hotel that I worked for as a night shift auditor suddenly changed my schedules and gave me rotating shifts which meant that most of the time I wouldn't be home to help momma, when I went too the manager to ask if I could go back to night shift after a week or 2 he said no, the company has needs to and basically demanded I chose between my mom and my job. What do you prefer?. So needless to say i quit immediately after, since then I've been unemployed just working what i can here and there actively looking for an either night shift or part time job so I don't abandon my mother.

Havent been able to find one, in mexico these jobs are scarce since we are paid per day rather that per hour most jobs demand you to work 8 hours a day 6 days a week with 1 random day off usually in the middle of the week. When there are part time jobs available they usually ask that you be a student or under age working as an assistant.

We've been going through quite a few struggles among them being lawyers and doctors, my father died without a last will so I need to do a lot of paper work, summing up, the house needs to be claimed but my mom and I inherit half and half, but she cant even sign papers anymore and she needs to be able to do so, hence I need to first be her legal caretaker which requires a trial and paying 2 psychology doctors to attest the level of her detriment regarding the alzheimer and each doctor costs a lot of money to give us that diagnosis and to testify in the trial (required by the court).

Besides I still need to have meds stocked the alzheimer pills (memantine), she has high blood pressure, she takes pills for depression because her alzheimer causes her to get depressed really easily, she takes a bunch of meds for the stomach, the skin, basically regular old people stuff added to her alzheimer's.

So I'm basically working anything and everything that I can mostly in the community with neighbors and such, building, cleaning yards, chopping down trees with an axe, cleaning roofs, bathing dogs in the rich neighborhood 15 minutes from where I live and anything that comes up online (online work didnt seem to work for me, maybe because I'm in mexico or because I dont fit the population needed for most of them).

2 months ago I was advised to go to the government office to ask for food and diaper support, but, the person in the office said they could give me a 1 time food box and then I would need to apply again in the future (they gave me 2 boxes of food from which I've used everything already so now we're living day by day again) and for the adult diaper support they told me that the current president shut down that program just this year (bummer) and diapers get quite expensive when somedays she doesnt even realize she wants to go potty.

Forgot to mention that I dont have college education either, that's a different story but basically when i finished highschool(18 y/o) i took a part time job to continue studying but in my first semester i met a girl (21 y/o) who i fell in love with (the ex i mention above) and i moved out with her and her 2 children (4 and 7 y/o respectively) a boy and a girl and I couldn't continue college then the circumstances above made it so I had to just focus on working the rest of the time. Still hoping to get college education some day but for now I have to work and take care of momma.

Anyway, that's about it with my story.

tl:dr

I am 26 y/o taking care of my mom who is 54 y/o with alzheimer's disease, we live alone the 2 of us together with no family nearby. I am unemployed currently and it's been getting really hard to afford the adult diapers since they seem to be quite expensive everywhere and the government program to help with these shut down this

"Hello, I just recently found a new job but was furloughed due to COVID-19 before I could even work my first shift. I luckily had a little bit in savings and have been trying to safely work on my side hustle of local online sales but I'm running out of funds and more importantly food &amp; water. I've been trying to stretch my food as much as I can by eating smaller and fewer meals but I've got about two, maybe three days of food and water left. The tap water not just in my home but my County is also not fit for consumption, filtered and/or boiled, due to arsenic contamination and it being naturally hard water with high levels of calcium and magnesium. I'm hoping I could get some assistance to get me through these trying times until my Stimulus Check arrives. I've posted this to a few different subreddits as well.

I've created a large list on Amazon, I don't expect everything on it to be purchased I just thought it would be better to have a variety of items it case something becomes unavailable. My Area Code is 86442.

Thank you to anyone that reads this and I wish you safety and security during these difficult times.

"Hello Food Pantry, 
On April 9th I started showing some symptoms that were similar to that of the Coronavirus. I’m a self-employed nanny who lost 2/3 jobs at the beginning of the virus spread and now am on hiatus with my last one to protect the family &amp; public from a potential infection. 

I’ve been in quarantine since then but am out of work for 2 weeks, am running low on food, and am not expecting pay until the end of the month. I’m usually pretty savvy with making out through these dry spells but because I’m low on funds and can’t leave my home, I’m in a tough spot. If you can help, it’d be greatly appreciated! I hope I have the opportunity to pay it forward when this all blows over.

"Hi! 

I was laid off from my job as an art instructor, and we're struggling to get food in Ohio (44641), we live in a very small town where things like instant cart and other like services don't work.

I'm currently living with my mother, older and disabled, myself young but with an immune system disorder, my Fiancé.

Normally we are fine, but without my income we're severely struggling.

I hate having to ask for help, but we missed the only food bank in our town and have to wait 2 weeks until it's open again. 

I have an Amazon list and will give other info if needed.

My amazon list is quite long, I'm not asking for all of that, just giving options and basically I picked anything in stock that I know we could/would use
Amazon is very sold out at the moment.. 

If you know of anything I should/could add to it please let me know. 

(For clarity, I did get dog and cat food from another group, and I have more on this list because I'm almost out of wet dog food for my dog that lacks teeth.) 

Thanks for your time and consideration.

"Here's my situation. I'm disabled. I have a strong back pain and venous insufficiency and neuropathy that makes walking not easy. I also don't have a license, and am dependent on a roommate to take me out. Sadly, we're not able to get to many stores in the new emergency-related hours of many stores, based on his work scheduled. I am on Social Security Disability for said disabilities and willing to provide evidence of this if required to prove my disability.

The major kicker is that I'm usually reliant on a weekly run to the food pantry. Sadly, our usual ride (A nextdoor neighbor who usually helps us out when Roomie isn't.) has more or less stopped taking us with them due to Social Distancing for the past month when this all started. Basically. We're running out of food because we're unable to reach one of our major weekly sources now- and it's unlikely we'll be able to restock in time next month just due to shortages and the small windows we have to actually reach places-- not to mention we don't really have the money to make up for the food boxes we get in the month really.

So yeah. We're running out of food. And I know that, lots of other people are too. And lots of people are asking for assistance. Regardless, I've setup an Amazon Wishlist still. I tried to pick... 'cheap bulk' where I could. And I feel horrible begging for help. But I don't have much of a choice.

I put it in the Title, but I'm USA in 35747 Zipcode. I don't think I'm breaking any rules so... here I go.

"Hello!

I am an international student living in the Netherlands (5037AB Tilburg). I live in a student complex and our common vacuum cleaner has been lost for the past few weeks. I am allergic to dust and my room makes me sneeze, now. Since I am an international here, I can only work part-time which I earn slightly below than my monthly expenses. Unfortunately, I cannot afford a vacuum cleaner. I have checked the second hand markets but there is no available one.

I would really appreciate if someone can help me with a vacuum cleaner. I added the cheapest stick vacuum I could find to my Amazon list. Also, I would be very happy if someone wants to provide me with some food. Because of all the virus issue, I am scared to go dumpster diving these days.

I am currently in my first year of uni however 1 month ago I got let off from my part time job. I have been getting help from my parents but they can't give me all that much since they themselves still have to provide for my younger siblings.

I apologise if what I'm asking is a bit much but if it's ok could I ask for help. I have a wishlist with mainly ramen since it's cheap meals and can last me until I get another job.

"I could cry. First of all, apologies to the mods for not meeting all criteria when I made my original post, but I did not mean to infringe on the rules. I DID get permission to post a thank you for the many of you who stepped in! And there were so many who, against my greatest hopes, helped me out with food and most importantly hygiene products. I had done the best I could with baking soda to fashion toothpaste and deodorant, but after I used all the baking soda, I was worried especially since I started the new job. Redditors like u/ella_jay18 u/terriroz u/peaceful-mammoth u/crawlinginyouryard, I can NOT thank you enough. The toothpaste, deodorant, body wash, Mac and cheese, crackers, dogs food and so much that I received was amazing. You guys nearly picked clean my wishlist which was not expected or even thought about, but is greatly appreciated. I know there were so many others who sent items who chose to remain anonymous, thank you too.

I truly don't say these words often as a human, but I do LOVE YOU guys! My first paycheck is this Friday and I now know without worry or stress that I will make it to my paycheck and having that anxiety carrying around on my shoulders is a weight that has been lifted and that alone is something that I cannot thank anyone enough for. Only those in my situation who have been helped in this regard understand the magnitude of how truly moving this experience has been. Keep an eye out for my posts in the future, I don't have much to offer as I continue to recoup from my moving, but I will have something available and I know that just having one item off my list would have meant the world to me so I will do the same for someone like me in the near future.

"Hi everyone. I hope I have enough recent activity to post here. My wife and I took in an unspayed cat that my previous neighbors left behind when they moved out. We hadn’t been able to afford to get her spayed yet and unfortunately now she has developed pyometra within the last couple days, which is an infection of the uterus and is very easily fatal, so my first month’s paycheck has gone towards getting her the surgery she needs instead of buying groceries and toiletry items. I won’t get paid again for a few more weeks. We have rice and ramen but not much other than that, and are on our last roll of toilet paper.

There are a few things that are high priority on the list (like toilet paper and wet cat food). The other things would be nice but are not as necessary.

"I forgot to say fulfilled. Thank you again, so much. ❤️

Edit: Zip code 98626. 

Hello there, I recently received assistance from r/RandomActsOfPetFood for my cats, but I am falling short for my own needs, so here I am. 


Between vet bills, the cost of cremation for my mother in law, and waiting for another trial for my wife to receive disability benefits, I’m having some difficulty making ends meet.


Unfortunately, I couldn’t pay one of my [utility bills](https://imgur.com/dVI0zad) on time last month, so that has doubled and now both are due for almost the same amount. (Note: The other bill is done every other month, we don’t use that much water!). So with those, plus my other bills, we will have basically nothing to spare for food or hygiene.


I’m hoping things will improve soon. I’m trying to find a job closer to home (my current one is 45 minutes away) but I don’t live in a great area for work, mostly I see part time or temporary positions and I can’t take that risk right now. I would get a second part time job, but I already work retail and don’t have a set schedule, so that complicates things.


If anyone could please help us make it through this rough time, it would be deeply appreciated. I absolutely love the idea of these giving subs and I hope to be on the other end of this soon.


Thank you. ❤️

"We have been in a rough spot lately my fiancee's hours at work haven't been the best he's asked for more but they don't have any more shifts to give and he has started looking for a second job on top of that one. I stay at home with our 6 month old daughter and I am looking for an at home job currently. I have posted before but didn't have enough karma yet. I commented and a few nice people helped me before. We were expecting my fiancee's tax return sooner but it hasn't came in yet. We are able to go to the local food pantry next week because it is a new month and we already went this month at the beginning of the month. We ran out of food stamps and won't get more until next month. I am looking for help with a bit of food, diapers, wipes, and necessities and gas for our car if anyone is able to help us a little until the end of the week which is pay day.

" I work online as ESL teachers. But our company is based in China and due to the virus, our paychecks have been delayed and I don’t think we will be paid until this coming Friday. I am behind on bills and have only some eggs and potatoes left. I’m stretching that out to last until Tuesday and then I have nothing. I’m also out of toilet paper and just keep getting extra from the gas station bathroom because I don’t have any money to my name.

I honestly tried to keep the list to things I could make nutritious and safe meals for myself. I have Celiac disease so everything I eat has to be completely gluten free. Even oats (regular are often cross contaminated with wheat). I’ve calculated I can make breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with all of these until at least Friday. I eat healthy and have only requested healthy foods. I requested the cheapest toilet paper I could find. I realize some of the things here might look pricy but due to Celiac I went with the most affordable and healthy safe foods. 

If anyone is able to help with some of this, I promise to pay it forward when finances are better.

Thank you in advance for your kindness.

"Some of you may remember me. I'm the woman who was considering giving my baby up for adoption due to our financial situation. This community helped my little family get on our feet and honestly I don't know if things would have worked out without your help.

An update upon birth was requested so I think you guys know why I'm back:)

IT'S A BOY!🖤💛💚💙

Riley Finn was born February 6 at 4:29pm via emergency C-section after an induction caused mom and baby's vitals to go haywire. 20 inches, 6 pounds, 6 ounces. He wasn't breathing for the first 2.5 minutes because I had to be put completely under when the epidural didn't fully numb me and I felt the initial incision and that can happen with anesthesia, but doctors got him breathing and he is healthy and safe and perfect.

Happy to say that my fiancé is head over heels crazy for his son and has turned out to be a complete natural. 

I'm not loving this recovery, but I'm grateful that my OB is an amazing doctor who reacted fast and kept us both safe. I knew things got very scary very fast when she hugged me the next day when she came to check on me. She's not the affectionate type.

Thanks again for all the help. I'm obsessed with my little boy and I couldn't be happier.

Hi there! This is my first time posting here so I hope I did this right! I’m pregnant with my first child due February 17th and I’m to be induced on the 10th, however my husband and I need a couple days of food to last until we get our food stamps on the 8th. My husband does collect unemployment but they’ve stopped his checks and we don’t know why as no one will answer the phone or call back. 

We don’t have much gas at the moment and I have an OB appointment on the 4th two towns over and we have zero money due to the unemployment situation.


I do collect WIC as well, but it doesn’t cover a whole lot, so most of this stuff is just to cover us til food stamps. I tried to make sure everything was prime and our address should be on the list. Anything at all helps, and it’s a quick list as I’ve noticed that things are super limited on prime like saltines for some reason.

"Hey everyone.   A few weeks ago we had a family emergency pop up ( my middle kid in another state went into pre-term labor) and my wife went down to TX to help/support her. So she can't work ATM, I am disabled on SSDI.

In the house are me, wife, 18 yr old son in college, 26 yr old daughter and her 3 yr old.

  We do receive EBT, but not until the 10th.  My daughter has a separate foodstamp case, but due to the current stress/drama missed her re-certification. She was told on the phone today it will likely be then end of Feb!

I don't have a license ( my wife drives normally) so I'm scared to head out to physical food pantries, if this doesn't pan out I will have to.

  Currently we about 2 dinners and ramen for lunches.  I've tried to pick the cheapest, most filling things. Some of them are bulk, but way cheaper than the smaller packages.  If there's a way to make a pantry list public, I haven't figured it out just yet.

  I have a bread machine and some yeast, so flour +tuna/mayo can be sandwiches. The coffee is a ""would be nice"" to increase my sanity lol.

  If anyone has suggestions/questions please leave a comment. Suggestions about types of food or deals on amazon are welcome, I tried to think of cheap/filling things and beans, pasta, and tuna were all  I could do on the spot. My daughter just got the news about her EBT today and I'm kind of in a state TBH.

"This is not a point in my life that I ever felt I would reach. So, I'm not really sure what to say. Short story, it's been a rough year for us and our safety net of savings has dwindled down to completely nothing and we have about $18 in the bank that has to last us another 2 weeks after paying bills. We have a few canned goods, nothing left in our deep-freeze, and are running out of household essentials really fast. I'm scared, I'm stressed, and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if my account meets the requirements for activity in the last 90 days, but I sincerely hope it does.

I tried to find the cheapest things that will feed everyone (2 adults, 5 kids aged 10-15). The reason I added the specific laundry soap and body wash is because my youngest daughter is allergic to so many different ones, these are the only ones we have found so far that do not break her out. Thank you for listening and thank you for any help I receive.

Longer, more in-depth backstory (sorry in advance for the novelette):

Last March, my grandmother had a stroke that left her pretty much unable to take care of herself. She was my grandfather's primary caregiver as he had gone blind with age and was on a walker. My father passed in 2011 and he was her only child (grandpa had a child from his first marriage, but only comes around when he wants money....he refused to help care for him), so my brother and I took turns taking care of him while she was in rehab for a month. Once her stay was up and she was able to come home and we got her set up on home health, I was able to stop staying going to her house every day (45 minutes, each direction) and going three times a week to do her laundry, cook food to put in the fridge for her to heat up and do the housework/shopping/etc.

Since my job is pretty flexible on my hours, with the exception of two afternoons I'm required to be there, I started arranging my hours around taking care of my grandparents. The amount of gas I was having to go through put me in a tight spot so I started doing freelance writing and user tests. It helped keep us from going into the negative but was really only covering gas costs. We were still okay. We had a small safety net that was helping us.

In June, the company my husband works for informed us they would be selling to new owners. When the new owners took over in July, our insurance costs almost tripled because it went from a health care plan for thousands (the original owners had multiple companies and used the same health care plan for all, which gave them a great group-rate discount) to a health care plan for about 50. To top it off, they moved the yard location from 10 minutes from our house to about 30 minutes from our house. So, an extra 40 minutes of driving each day for his commute, and an increase in gas consumption.

Come August, my grandfather got sick. Bad sick. We took him to the doctor (which should have been red flag #1, because he was adamant about never going to the doctor....he hated them, they scared him) and they sent us to the ER for his gallbladder. They cleared him for emergency surgery, took him in, he had a heart attack on the table and they had to halt surgery and put him in ICU. A few days later he was stable enough to continue the surgery. During all of this, they discovered he was going through liver failure, kidney failure, and heart failure. After a few weeks of ICU and life-support, our family made the decision to let him go in peace because he would not be able to recover. He passed shortly after in September.

In October, my grandmother had another mini-stroke which caused her to fall. So, back to every other day visits again. I took on more freelance work. My husband started looking for work on his days off. We were dipping into our savings more frequently and it only had enough left to float us a few more months. They decreased my husband's hours at work. He was barely even getting 30 a week at this point. We were use to 60 hours a week. We tightened our belt buckles even more. We started cutting everything non-essential to lower our bills. Then his car broke down. The only person in this area that will work on it, because it's a Volkswagon, is notorious for doubling or tripling the amount that anyone else would charge. So, fixing it not really an option. We don't have the funds.

After a few weeks of me driving him to and from work, then coming home to get the kids ready for school and dropped off (the bus doesn't run early enough to get them to their before-school activities), we are able to borrow a car. However, it has an oil leak so he has to keep topping it up every few days. It costs less than the gas it takes to have me take him back and forth, so it's workable.

Come November, we get a notice in the mail that our water company is changing their rates from a ""minimum usage"" fee to a monthly membership fee plus usage. This now doubles our water bill every month. They're the only company so we don't have options to switch and do not have a water well. We always try to pay ahead a year on utilities with what we get back on our income taxes. Now that the price has doubled, it's eaten through our pre-payment.

Our electric bill kept increasing each month. We can't figure out why. We always shut everything off when we leave, we keep the central heat and air on an energy-efficient mode to keep costs down. Oldest step-daughter confesses she's been getting hot at night, so she's been keeping her window open at night and shutting it in the morning instead of closing the vent in her room. Since her room is right by the control unit, this means it's been running pretty much non-stop every night for months. We use what's left in our savings to pay off the balance owed.

We notice my food storage supply is dwindling. Luckily I'm a bargain shopper. I buy everything in bulk, I keep everything stocked. I coupon like crazy. But we've been using it to supplement the decrease in our budget, so it's getting ridiculously low. We visit our local food bank. They helped us but inform us they could not help us again unless we brought social security cards for everyone in our household. A while back, we lost all our important paperwork when our utility room flooded.

This wouldn't be a problem, normally, because we were able to get a replacement social security card and birth certificates for me, my husband, my two bio kids and two of his bio kids. HOWEVER, we are unable to get my oldest step-daughter's card without her birth certificate. My husband wasn't listed on her birth certificate, so regardless of the fact that we have the custody papers showing he has primary custody, the Department of Health will not release her birth certificate without the biological mother's signature. We haven't seen her in years, so we can't get her signature. So, without that social security card, they can't help us because too many people abuse the system and claim people that aren't living with them to get extra food. We don't qualify for food stamps or any other resources. We have used the last of my stockpile on everything and I'm scared. Flat out terrified. My kids know that money is tight right now, they're good about not complaining when we've had soup or beans for the 4th time that week, but they don't realize just how tight it is. It's to the point that my husband and I don't eat during the day and at dinner, we tell the kids we ate a big lunch and only eat about half a portion so that we know they have enough. I had to let my car insurance lapse because I couldn't afford the full payment after paying the mortgage, I've only got about a quarter tank of gas, and I'm starting to get desperate.

I'm sorry I wrote a novel, I guess I just needed to vent my frustrations to someone who wouldn't judge us negatively for the situation we are in. Thanks again for listening.

"I'm swallowing my pride in desperation...I lost my job a while back and was on unemployment, which ran out about six months ago. During this time, my car needed multiple repairs, my brother and I were forced to leave our old apartment and find a new one (not an easy task while unemployed and my bro making minimum wage)...I'm still struggling to find work, currently working 3-6 hours a week under the table for someone and taking freelance graphic design work whenever possible but the fact is that I have completely burned through all of my savings that I had, my credit card debt is piling up, and I now have about $130 to my name. I will be able to pay the electric bill next month and not much else. 

I have been living off of rice and pasta and not much else, and can't afford much else any more. I could really use a little bit of help. Even things like my impending time of month is stressing me out because I can't afford tampons. I'm applying to every job I see and still hoping for the best, but for now, I need a little help. Thank you all so much.

I had a hard time figuring out wishlists and things...I also couldn't figure out how to add things from prime pantry (is that possible?), because that's where all the vegetables and things are and I've been living off nothing but carbs for the most part.

"A few months ago, I was starving, desperate, and in a bad enough situation that I was looking into giving my baby up for adoption, if the baby even survived, which was a big concern as this is my third pregnancy and I have no living children yet. My fiance and I had no jobs, no hope, and no food. I couldn't even get to an OB.

Now I'm happily, healthily 37 weeks pregnant. My fiancé has a full time job. I STILL have plenty of rice and beans, and I've managed to create a well stocked pantry that keeps us from ever going hungry. I'm receiving regular prenatal care and eating well and my baby will be here soon, and my fiance and I are very excited to welcome our little boy or girl to the world.

I cannot thank you guys enough for all your help. You got us through a really difficult patch, and helped make it possible for us to keep and care for this kid. We hope to pay it forward and become more active on this sub soon, after we stock up on some diapers, of course:) 

You're wonderful people. I'd hug each and every one of you who sent us food if I could. Thank you thank you thank youuuu🖤 I'll be grateful forever! I wish you all the good things in life:)

"As the title says, my husband got fired today, and due to something he had no control over, and actually pointed out to the company... We are on a very tight debt repayment plan, due to a severe mental break I had about 9 months ago. All of the money for that was coming from his job, with money for bills barely being covered. So his last check will be all to the debt repayment. He's going to start looking starting tomorrow, but he doesn't interview well (thanks to severe dyslexia and associated issues). I may be forced to go back to work against doctors recommendations...


Besides my husband and I, there are two teens in the house as well. I do make use of the local church food bank, and am able to get beans and rice, and peanut butter and jelly, but as of today have no way to supplement any of that... I've already been working with as many dried and canned ingredients as I can. One problem with that being that the gynecologist wants both me and one of the teens on a low carb (more paleo) diet due to PCOS. Mine is severe, hers isn't as bad, but she has some really bad blood levels.


I do apologize as this is more than half ramble, but we are all stressed out and trying to figure out how to make do. Family is already helping as much as they can, we only have one vehicle... We're waiting for a decision on SNAP, it's ""under review""...  If we had SNAP, I wouldn't have to be asking here for things...


If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to message me and ask. I've tried to trim things down, substitute things for cheaper, cut out unnecessary things...



EDIT: Amazon wishlist (edited), removed Walmart list as it was unusable for some reason, moved cat supplies to another list for another sub. 

Edit 2:  When it rains, it pours... Our dishwasher went out, permanently. No problem doing them by hand, but can it stop please?

"Hi Reddit,

unfortunately life has taken a hopefully temporary but very rough turn. Due to my job lying to me about how I'd be scheduled and trained, I've gotten behind on paying for rent, phone and things, and am completely broke for the next 2 weeks, due to my attempts to catch up. I have no money to buy groceries or anything else until I get paid again. So this request for help is hopefully only temporary.

Any help you'd be willing to give would be extremely appreciated, and thank you so much for reading.

"Hello. My family 4 adults (2 elderly and 1 disabled) are needing a little food assistance. My boyfriend and I are staying with his elderly parents while we try to get back on our feet. The past year and a half have been very rough with me losing my car, which was the only transport in the house, and me losing my storage unit that held my entire apartment. We are both searching for jobs doing pretty much anything and i'm even looking to walk dogs. Parents get monthly check but are terrible with money and refuse help to make it last. Usually my pride wont let me ask for help but at this point im desperate. I've pnly been eating peanut butter the last few days. Any help given would be a blessing.
